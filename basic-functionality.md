One of the beautify things about Harp Guru is the depth of investigation which is possible despite it's simple interface. But while it might be simple, it is not self explanatory and you may find that you're only using 50% of the app and missing all the magic that's hidden around the back or in the corner where you weren't looking.

So in this video we'll be giving you 2 things:

1. A quick overview of all of the components and menu's in Harp Guru.
2. Links to some other video's, with deeper dives in to each of those components and menu's.

Let's jump in:

# Harpface / linear legend

The most important part of the app is what we call the 'harpface'. This is the representation of the blow and draw notes on your harmonica, along with all of the bends of various types and extents. So for example, this is the 1 blow marked here as a C, the 2 draw here is a G, and the 2 bends below the 2 draw are identified on this harp as a Gb/A# and A.

Being an app, this is interactive, so if you punch the 2 draw for example it will either light up in a colour or return to white, and then all the other identical notes will follow suite. So now all of the G's are off, and after hitting the 2 draw again they are now all on. We're also notified that we've now turned on all the notes for a major pentatonic scale, which is nice isn't it.

Since this a representation of a particular harp, everything you see here will change depending on the harp you are playing and the position you are playing it in. We'll demonstrate that a little in a minute, but first let's quickly introduce the linear legend.

The legend is a reference tool to support the harpface. It gives you a simplified, linear view on the notes selected as well as a translation between pitches and scale degrees. The tonic or root will always be at the top in green and scale degrees are represented linearly down from there. The colours in the legend relate to the colours in the harpface and knowing that means that we now know that the G on the 2 hole draw is our root note which many will immediately recognise as means we're in second position.

Let's see how things change when we go from 2nd to 3rd position. Close your eyes for a moment, we'll explain this menu after we've made this point. In 3rd position the G on a C harmonica is no longer green, it's now purple meaning it's not the root any more, it's now the 4th as you can see in the linear legend. You might have some questions about this. That's probably a good sign, and I expect we can answer them. If they're not answered as we move through the rest of this demonstration then they most likely are covered in the deeper dive videos. And any questions you have left over can be addressed to me directly. I'll be happy to answer them. Contact details are in the description or you can leave a youtube comment here of course.

(. This follows a standard model apparently developed by Dennis Gruenling, (that bit of information from Richard Sleighs HotRodHarmonica.com by the way). You'll have probably have seen )



# Keys and positions menu

One of the most important functions of Harp Guru is to model the relationships between pitches and scale degrees as you change the key of your harp and the position you play it in. That's what this menu is for.

This menu has 3 properties, the harp key, the position you play the harp in, and the key that you end up playing in. When you change one of these things, one other will change with it and one will stay the same. The deep dive video on this menu will help you understand that concept, but once you get it this menu is quite simple to use. The properties I just mentioned are layed out across 3 screens which you can move between with these arrow buttons. On each screen one of the properties is over here on the left which means that it is locked. It will be the one which doesn't change as you change the other two.

So in this situation, we want to keep using the same harp which is in the key of C, meaning we need to use the screen where "harp key" is the property on the left, and now when we change from 2nd to 3rd position we see that we consequently are no longer playing in the key of G, but rather the key of D.

The results play out on the harpface and in the linear legend and you have every possible way of playing all 12 of your Richter tuned harps configurable from this menu, in no more than 3 button presses.

Exiting the menu is achieved with the cross in the right hand corner.

# Settings menu

But what if you're not using a Richter tuned harmonica, well that's one of the things the general settings menu covers. From here you can choose from the list of alternate tunings starting with the standard major diatonic (or Richter) tuning or any others from this list. You can see the effect on the harpface is to produce a different shaped grid of notes to play, representing the different bends available which are driven by the differently tuned notes on the standard blow and draw holes. You can see here on this Wilde tuned harp that we have 2 adjacent E's on the blow reeds which is obviously different to what you're used to on a Richter. There are plans to add more tunings to this list. It's relatively easy to do and it will be getting done, but at the time of creating this video it's not reached the top of the priority list yet.

I'll just put this back to Major Diatonic before continuing or I'll make life hard for myself later.

In this menu we've also got options to identify which notes we want to be tested on in quiz mode which we'll demonstrate shortly. Currently Harp Guru is configured to quiz us on all the scale degrees. If we only wanted to be quized on the Root notes then we could clear this list and then just select Root. If we wanted to be quized on the Root, 2, 4, 5 & 6 that we've got on the harpface right now then we can select "Sync with active harp", and now you can see just the Root, 2, 4, 5 & 6 are selected here. We'll see the effect of this when we look at quiz mode breifly below.

# Scales menu

The scales menu does what it says on the tin, it allows you to select scales for representation on the harpface and linear legend. We have split scales and chords in to separate screens accessible with these arrows, but the concept is the same for both. Select Minor triad here and the Root, flat3 & 5th will be turned on in the harpface and legend. This is 3rd position remember, in case it wasn't what you were expecting to see.

We can put this back to 2nd position if it's more familiar, but oh! that might not be what you were expecting to happen, we no longer have the Root, flat3 and 5th, we have the 2nd, 5th and flat7. What really happened is that we still have the Dminor triad (DFA) we initially set, but in the context of 2nd position those notes play a different role. This is deliberate and useful behaviour from Harp Guru, but not what we want right now. We want to preserve the scale degrees so that when we change position or key the scale or chord we selected stays the same. That's one of the functions of the next button in the menu.

# Pitch / Degree orientation

So far we've seen the harpface with pitches on it and the linear legend with scale degrees. Well sometimes we want to reverse that which is exactly what the display mode button does. The application of this is obviuos, it's to accomodate your thought process whether it's pitch or scale degree oriented.

But there's an extra function to this. This is where you control the priority of pitch vs degree in all your key and position manipulations. With the scale degrees given the priority on the harpface, if we select a minor triad again, and then change back to 3rd position, you can see that this time the change of position doesn't change the scale degrees we have selected, it changes the notes we're using to play those degrees.

Dmionr triad in 3rd position, Gminor triad in 2nd position. You'll see the notes, but not the colours or position in the linear legend changing when we do this.

# Register segmentation

The next tab down the side here is for octave segmentation.

# Quiz mode

# Page selection

You'll notice that the menu tabs are colour coded. White means this is a menu from which to make a selection, yellow means this is a quick action tab with no options underneith it, and pink just means this is something completely different again, and what this is is a page selection button. Harp Guru has 3 pages with totally independent harpfaces with their own sets of options.

There are several occasions when you might want to set up different harps rather than doing all of your work on a single one. The best example I like to give is for a 12 bar blues. You have 3 key changes, and depending on how you want to play through those key changes you could set up 3 different scales and flip between them as you're playing along. There are loads of other reasons this is useful. I find that once you know it's there are you understand the example I've just given then you know when you need it, and it'll be really helpful.
