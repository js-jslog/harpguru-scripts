One of the beautify things about Harp Guru is the depth of investigation which is possible despite it's simple interface. But while it might be simple, it is not self explanatory and you may find that you're only using 50% of the app and missing all the magic that's hidden around the back or in the corner where you weren't looking.

So in this video we'll be giving you 2 things:

1. A quick overview of all of the components and menu's in Harp Guru.
2. Links to some other video's, with deeper dives in to each of those components and menu's. Stick around for the overview first though. It'll bed you in before In fact if you want to go straight in to the detail then listen no further and just look in the video description for all the links now.

If you're still here then I guess you want the overview, so here we go:

# Harpface / linear legend

The most important part of the app is what we call the 'harpface'. This is the representation of the blow and draw notes on your harmonica, along with all of the bends of various types and extents. So for example, this is the 1 blow marked here as a C, the 2 draw here is a G, and the 2 bends below the 2 draw are identified on this harp as a Gb/A# and A.

Being an app, this is interactive, so if you punch the 2 draw for example it will either light up in a colour or return to white, and then all the other identical notes will follow suite. So now all of the G's are off, and after hitting the 2 draw they are now all on. We're also notified that we've now turned on all the notes for a major pentatonic scale, which is nice isn't it.

Since this a representation of a particular harp, everything you see here will change depending on the harp you are playing and the position you are playing it in. We'll demonstrate that a little in a minute, but first let's quickly introduce the linear legend.

The legend is a reference tool to support the harpface. It gives you a simplified, linear view on the notes selected as well as a translation between pitches and scale degrees. The tonic or root will always be at the top in green and scale degrees are represented linearly down from there. The colours in the legend relate to the colours in the harpface and knowing that means that we now know that the G on the 2 hole draw is our root note which many will immediately recognise as telling us that we're in second position.

Let's see how things change when we go from 2nd to 3rd position. Close your eyes for a moment, we'll explain this menu after this point. In 3rd position the G on a C harmonica is no longer green, it's now purple meaning it's not the root any more, it's now the 4th. 

(. This follows a standard model apparently developed by Dennis Gruenling, (that bit of information from Richard Sleighs HotRodHarmonica.com by the way). You'll have probably have seen )
