One of the biggest factors in chosing a position to play a scale in is; how easy is it. Well there are 4 positions on a PentaHarp where a mixolydian scale requires no overblows. But there's many more interesting things to consider in getting the most out of your choice and tooday we'll dive in to this question using Harp Guru, showing why people are saying that Harp Guru has "saved them years of research" and at the end we'll tell you how you can enter a giveaway to win a pentaharp of your own courtesy of Hohner themselves and their generous UK distributors Sutherland trading.

The 4 positions we're talking about here are 9th, 10th, 11th & 12th. Don't let those high numbers scare you. These are the easiest positions to play mixolydian in, and if you're not familiar with positions and why they shouldn't scare you in *general* then check out my introductions to positions linked below.

So 4 positions using only blow, draw and draw bends already means that we can play in 4 keys on a single harp. For example, on this C PentaHarp we can play a mixolydian in F, Bb, Eb & Ab. If some of those keys don't sound very useful to you then how about we change the harp key to an A (which means that in 9th position we'll be playing in the key of F) where if we come back to listing the available positions for that harp key you can see you'll be able to play in F, C, G & D in 9th, 10th, 11th & 12th position. Those are some useful keys.

Actually, most of the available PentaHarps will give you a good common set of keys in all of 9th, 10th, 11th & 12th positions, just the C as we've already seen, and the Bb as I'm showing now will have you potentially playing flat versions of much more common keys so watch out for that when you're making your first purchase decision if you want to be playing mixolydian and other major key tunes.

Ok, so apart from the key that we'll be playing in, what other features of these positions separate them from one another? Let's start with 9th.

# 9th

The first thing that stands out about 9th position is that the root note is on a double bend. This by itself might place 9th position as one of the harder positions for some. The root note is one of those notes that you'll want to hold and we all know that holding a bend can be a little tricky. Still, we also know that the tonal characteristics of a bent note are different to an unbent one and it's not often we get to bend *down* to our root, so that could lead to some unique sounds.

2 familiar faces from our Richter tuned playing is this architypically bluesy 5 / 7b doublestop and the 5b to 5 scoop which is often heard accompanying the doublestop. Something new that the PentaHarp offers, apart from being able to do this in 3 octaves consistently as we have come to expect, is that the 5b can be bent down further to the 4. You only need to think as far as the 12 bar blues to imagine a Vchord to IVchord transition which probably hasn't had a nice complete scoop applied to it much. A Richter tuned harp can do this in 5th and 10th position, but only in one octave and 10th position's root note is on an overblow in 2 octaves which is probably why none of us mortals have thought much about playing it.

Now we're talking about the 5b here which of course isn't part of the mixolydian scale, but we do know that the 5b can just slide in to many many mixolydian contexts, as can the 3b. If you are playing a major blues you'll often want to throw in some minor tension using these notes, so it's a shame that in 9th position the 3b is an overblow, putting it out of reach of most of us.

But hey, you know where it's not an overblow, is in 10th position.

# 10th

In 10th position we have both the 3b and the 5b, and look, the 3b is one of the unbent notes which means that there aren't any unbent notes which might be considered "wrong notes", at least in the blues which should put your mind at ease. We've also still got the complete scoop from the 4 to the 5 through the 5b, but we no longer have the 5 / 7b doublestop that we had in 9th.

Something Will Wilde would approve of is that we've got both our root and our 5th on draw reeds which means we can get lots of power & texture in them. The root and 5th are amongst the most likely notes to be being held in any context so this is a great general purpose feature.

And while we're on general purpose feature, 10th is the only position which has a traditional triad to chug on. It's a minor triad which unfortunately means it's not a perfect harmonising accompaniment to the mixolydian backing you'll be playing against, but there's bound to be good effect it can be put to yet.

# 11th

Looking at 11th position we can see that we have something familiar again, and unique (so far) to 11th as well, which is that we can scoop up from the 3b to the major 3rd. This is reminiscent of what we have in 3rd position on a Richter harp, and of course 2nd position as well except that we can't bend further down to the 2 like we can in second position. Still, we know that this is nice to have, but unfortunately this time, in contrast to 9th position, this time we are missing the 5b as its up on the overblows.

# 12th

12th position has the same issue again with the missing 5b, but all of the necessary bends for the mixolydian are only on halfstep bends which might be beneficial depending on your bending ability or your desire for speed.

And of course the following are all true of all the positions; they'll have their own doublestops and warbles available which will work to various degrees in various contexts. We have a 4 / 7b available here in 12th for example. What does that sound like? Well you're going to just have to play it and see. The same is true with the fact that there really is no such thing as a wrong note and that the role each note plays changes through a chord progression, so while we've not said much about the major 7ths, 6bs & 2bs which occupy the unbent non-mixolydian notes in 9th, 11th and 12th position that doesn't mean that they can't be used to good effect.

Exploring all of this properly will of course require a PentaHarp. But to interrogate the meaning of what you're hearing and to come up with ideas to try out requires a solid understanding of what you've got in your hands and there is no better tool for that job than Harp Guru.

So if you would like to download Harp Guru you can do so now in both the Android and iOS stores, and if you would like a PentaHarp you can buy one of them too, or possibly you could just win one right here. All you need to do is give this video a like and a comment and wait for the 15th January when the winner will be contacted. Thanks again to Hohner and Sutherland trading for this giveaway, and thanks to you for watching.

Add a first comment "I think the conclusion that for playing in major keys we might get the most value from a D, G, A or E tuned PentaHarp rather than C and Bb is espcially interesting. What do you think?"

In the facebook posting we could say something like "This video draws many conclusions including that a D tuned PentaHarp is more useful for playing major blues than a C tuned one. If that sounds like a strange thing to say then listen in to find out why".

Ask Steve Baker whether he has a recomendation for backing tracks which would be allowed to be used by me.
