One of the biggest factors in chosing a position to play a scale in is; how easy is it. Well there are 4 positions on a PentaHarp where a mixolydian scale requires no overblows. So what else might be a factor in our decision? Today we'll dive in to this question using Harp Guru, really showing off why Harp Guru is helping people to "quote"... and at the end we'll tell you how you can enter a giveaway ...

The Mixolydian scale is a foundational scale in many forms of music, especially those to which the haromica has been most famously associated. And without overblows you can play a mixolydian scale in 4 positions on a PentaHarp. 9th, 10th, 11th & 12th.

Don't let those high numbers scare you. These are theThat already means we can play in 4 keys on a single harp, for example on this c PentaHarp we can play a mixolydian in F, Bb.... without overblows

There are lots of factors which come in to play when picking a position to play a given scale. A big one is simplicity, so we'll be looking at 9th, 10th, 11th and 12th position here, where the mixolydian scale can be played in full with no overblows. You're going to need to be able to bend to play mixolydian in any of these positions though, so what else can we look for when deciding which of these positions to use?

# 9th

# Available
- Scoop up from 5b to 5
- 5, 7b doublestop
- Can swap the 7b for the 7 to get the major scale and with the 5b you can get some of the country sound, but without the 3b you'll be missing a little bit of what we expect from a "country tuning"
- Something we don't get to do much is bend down a whole step to our root note. I'm sure there are some nice tonic resolutions resulting from that.
- Double-bend-double-stop  1/4 to 2/5, probably works better than the other  way around because 1/4...

# Missing
- 3b which rules out any basic western minor flourishes. The 5b and to some extent the 2b can be used, but for the majority of our playing the 3b is the real foundational element to minor sounds.
- 6b

# 10th

# Available
- Both the root and the 5th are on straight draws. Since these are our 2 most stable notes they are the ones that we're most often going to hold and want to put 
- Scoop up from 5b to 5
- Both the 3b & the major 7, which means we can access the country sound
- We have a minor triad available. Triads are hard to come by on the pentaharp so this is noteworthy, but potentially a little difficult to use in contexts where you are also using a mixolydian scale

They all only have 1 note to deliberately miss out from the unbent notes.
