One of the biggest factors in chosing a position to play a scale in is; how easy is it. Well there are 4 positions on a PentaHarp where a mixolydian scale requires no overblows. But there's many more interesting things to consider in getting the most out of your choice and tooday we'll dive in to this question using Harp Guru, showing why Harp Guru is helping people to "quote"... and at the end we'll tell you how you can enter a giveaway to win a pentaharp of your own courtesy of Hohner themselves and their generous UK distributors Sutherland trading.

The Mixolydian scale is a foundational scale in many forms of music, especially those to which the haromica has been most famously associated. And without needing overblows you can play a mixolydian scale in 4 positions on a PentaHarp. 9th, 10th, 11th & 12th.

Don't let those high numbers scare you. These are the easiest positions to play mixolydian in, and if you're not familiar with positions and why *they* shoudln't scare you either then check out my introductions to positions linked below.

So 4 positions using only blow, draw and bends already means that we can play in 4 keys on a single harp. For example, on this c PentaHarp we can play a mixolydian in F, Bb, Eb & Ab. If some of those keys don't sound very useful to you then how about we change the harp key to an A (which means that in 9th position we'll be playing in the key of F) where if we come back to listing the available positions for that harp key you can see you'll be able to play in F, C, G & D in 9th, 10th, 11th & 12th position. Those are some useful keys.

Actually, most of the available PentaHarps will give you a good common set of keys in 9th, 10th, 11th & 12th positions, just the C as we've already seen, and the Bb as I'm showing now will have you potentially playing flat versions of much more common keys so watch out for that when you're making your first purchase decision if you want to be playing mixolydian and other major key tunes.

So we're quite 






That already means we can play in 4 keys on a single harp, for example on this c PentaHarp we can play a mixolydian in F, Bb.... without overblows

There are lots of factors which come in to play when picking a position to play a given scale. A big one is simplicity, so we'll be looking at 9th, 10th, 11th and 12th position here, where the mixolydian scale can be played in full with no overblows. You're going to need to be able to bend to play mixolydian in any of these positions though, so what else can we look for when deciding which of these positions to use?

# 9th

# Available
- Scoop up from 5b to 5
- 5, 7b doublestop
- Can swap the 7b for the 7 to get the major scale and with the 5b you can get some of the country sound, but without the 3b you'll be missing a little bit of what we expect from a "country tuning"
- Something we don't get to do much is bend down a whole step to our root note. I'm sure there are some nice tonic resolutions resulting from that.
- Double-bend-double-stop  1/4 to 2/5, probably works better than the other  way around because 1/4...

# Missing
- 3b which rules out any basic western minor flourishes. The 5b and to some extent the 2b can be used, but for the majority of our playing the 3b is the real foundational element to minor sounds.
- 6b

# 10th

# Available
- Both the root and the 5th are on straight draws. Since these are our 2 most stable notes they are the ones that we're most often going to hold and want to put 
- Scoop up from 5b to 5
- Both the 3b & the major 7, which means we can access the country sound
- We have a minor triad available. Triads are hard to come by on the pentaharp so this is noteworthy, but potentially a little difficult to use in contexts where you are also using a mixolydian scale

They all only have 1 note to deliberately miss out from the unbent notes.







If you're thinking of playing major key and specifically mixolydian scales on the Pentaharp then possibly the key of A will


Add a first comment "I think the conclusion that for playing in major keys we might get the most value from an A tuned PentaHarp is espcially interesting. What do you think?"
