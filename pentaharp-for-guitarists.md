PentaHarp hype is rising and with half the world still waiting for it to even hit their local distributers there's a thirst for knowledge, not least amongst one of the key target groups, guitar players who want to incorporate harmonica in to their sound and have heard that this is the best way to do it.

In this video we'll see exactly how much more intuitive and less technical it is to play blues and minor pentatonic melodies on the PentaHarp than on a standard Richter tuned harp and then at the end I'll tell you how you can get your hands on a brand new PentaHarp courtesy of Hohner themselves and their generous UK distributers Sutherland Trading. This offer is open to all global participants but if you happen to win and live in one of the many regions where the PentaHarp is still not available then you'll have the only PentaHarp for miles around for weeks or even months before anyone else.

We're going to be using Harp Guru for this lesson. As a guitar player you might never have heard of Harp Guru, and you might have never seen even a non-interactive version
of the layout charts that Harp Guru has taken to the next level. But as a guitar player you probably do understand the power of visualisation so let's start with a quick
orientation of what we're' looking at.

Every hole on a harmonica has 2 reeds. A blow reed and a draw reed. Those reeds are represented here on the harpface as the cells inside this grey box. We have 10 holes on the
harmonica so we have 10 pairs of holes inside this grey box. So if you blow on hole 1 you will hear a C, and if you draw (which is what we call inhaling) then you will hear a D#, otherwise known as Eb. You can see that these notes are colour coded as Green and Orange to represent the root and 3b, and if  we repeat this blow and draw pattern on holes 2 & 3, we get F which is the the 4th in purple, Gb which is the 5b in dark blue, G which is the 5th in sky blue and Bb which is the 7b in pink, making the blues scale. The notes above and below the grey box can only be played with special techniques called bending and overblowing. These are techniques we can use to take all harmonicas beyond their primary design focus. But when the designed focus fits your needs, then this is the harmonica at it's kindest and easiest to play.

In the Hohner official PentaHarp for guitarists video (link in the description) Payton Taylor & TJ Watson give a great account of their desire to *just be able to play in the box* to go along with the guitar they were playing and the frustration they felt with how unintuitive it is to do that on a regular Richter tuned harp.

Well we can see that playing in the box looks easy enough on the PentaHarp, but how much easier is it than on a regular Richter tuned harp. Let's take a look.

This is a standard Richter tuned harmonica, playing the blues scale the way it most commonly is, and you can see immediately what they're talking about. The first thing you'll notice is that there is way more variance in breathing pattern. The breathing pattern you play in this octave is very different from the pattern you play in this octave.

You can also see that there are other notes which you need to jump over. Some of them could sound great, like the 2 or even the 6 depending on the context, but this 3 probably isn't going to fit if you're in a minor context and the point is that these players just wanted to play in the box with that blues scale and minor pentatonic with minimum effort. The pentaharp is giving us a much more regular pattern and "no wrong notes". For someone who just wants to let loose that's very helpful.

The next thing is you can see how many of the notes of the blues scale fall outside the home row. That means that you need those special techniques to play these notes. This is the *most common way* to play this scale on a standard harmonica. It's not easy. It has it's own benefits, but being easy is not one of them.

And there's more. You see how down here the blow reed is always lower than the draw reed (6 is lower than 7b, 1 is lower than 2), but up here the blow reed is *higher* than the draw reed (4 is higher than 3, 6 is higher than 5). That means that playing at the top of the harmonica is different in many ways to playing lower down. Notice down here we've got two identical notes right next to each other too. All of this stuff is the result of wonderful engineering, it's fascinating to understand and amazingly rich in what it can produce. But it's not easy!

So without a doubt, if you want to play in the box like Payton & TJ, that's how much easier it is to do it on the PentaHarp. And if you're now sold or you just like fee stuff then let's talk giveaways. Hohner and their uk distributor Sutherland Trading are offering a free PentaHarp to one lucky winner.

In this video we'll see exactly what the PentaHarp is making possible for those with limited time to learn the harmonica, exactly what is so much simpler on a PentaHarp than on a regular Richter tuned harp and why, and then at the end I'll tell you how you can get your hands on a brand new PentaHarp courtesy of Hohner themselves and their generous UK distributers Sutherland Trading. This offer is open to all global participants but if you happen to win and live in one of the many regions where the PentaHarp is still not available then you'll have the only PentaHarp for miles around for weeks or even months before anyone else.

So if you blow on hole 1 you will hear a C, and if you draw (which is what we call inhaling) then you will hear a D#, otherwise known as Eb. The notes above and below the grey box can only be played with special techniques called bending and overblowing. You'll soon be interested to know how to get the bends at least, but let's ignore them and the overblows (which are much harder) entirely. As a beginner harmonica player you'll want to know what you can do without these techniques. And there's a lot! So pay attention.

All harmonica's are tweaked to be particularly good at some things, and for the pentaharp this is making melodies, specifically melodies made with the pentatonic scales and the blues scale. That's not to say that you can't play chords or heptatonic scales too, but your low hanging fruit on the PentaHarp is minor pentatonic melodies, and there is nothing quite as direct and reliable as a pentatonic solo.

In Harp Guru we identify the notes of a scale by highlighting the relevant harp face cells in colour. So on hole 1 we can play the root note which is always green which is a C
by blowing, we can then play the flat 3 which is orange and plays an Eb by drawing on hole 1 as we saw before. If we repeat that blow draw pattern up one hole then we will
hear the 4th and then the 5b on hole2, and then up again 1 hole we will hear the 5th and the 7b on hole 3, and then that gives us all the notes of the blues scale. And, you can see this pattern repeats exactly the same in the next octave. So, simple & consistent breathing pattern means intuitive locating of the note you want to play, which means simple melody making.

Let's see exactly what they are talking about. This is a standard Richter tuned harmonica, playing the blues scale the way it most commonly is, and you can see immediately what they're problem is. The first thing you'll notice is that there is way more variance in breathing pattern. The breathing pattern you play in this octave is very different from the pattern you play in this octave. You can also see that there are other notes which you need to jump over. Some of these might sound fine, like the 2 or even the 6 depending on the context, but this 3 is probably isn't going to fit if you're in a minor context and the point is that these players just wanted that direct pentatonic sound with minimum effort. The pentaharp is giving us a much more regular pattern and "no wrong notes". For someone who just wants to let loose that's very helpful.

There is a deeper level of complexity in the Richter tuned harmonica too. You see how down here the blow reed is always lower than the draw reed (6 is lower than 7b, 1 is lower than 2), but up here the blow reed is *higher* than the draw reed (4 is higher than 3, 6 is higher than 5).

All of this stuff is the result of wonderful engineering, it's fascinating to understand and amazingly rich in what it can produce. But it's not easy!

So the pentaharp is making minor pentatonic and blues scales just about as easy as it's possible to make them. You still have to learn how to play single notes. That's the first job of any harmonica player. With the pentaharp you have the opportunity to stop right there and let your intuitions guide you.

This is the first in a 3 part series on the pentaharp. We're done talking about why it is the fastest way to start playing blues scale and minor pentatonic melodies

This is level 1, for guitarists mostly. There's no reason that you can't learn any other tuning of harmonica, but if you just want quick access to that minor pentatonic and blues scale sound to let rip then you can see that the pentaharp is going to give you intuitive and direct access as fast as possible.

Play single notes that's your first job as any kind of harmonica player. The level one draw of the pentaharp is that you can stop right there and play pentatonic solos in 3 octaves with just about as little effort investment in a harmoinca as you could ever hope for.
