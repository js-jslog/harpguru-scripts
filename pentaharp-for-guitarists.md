The PentaHarp is still causing lots of discussion and confusion, not least amongst one of the largest target groups, that is guitar players who want to incorporate harmonica
in to their sound without needing to learn all the techniques and irregularities that makes learning harmonica a surprisingly complex task.

In this video we'll see exactly what the PentaHarp is trying to make available as low hanging fruit for you, see exactly why that stuff is so much simpler on a PentaHarp than
on a regular Richter tuned harp, and then at the end I'll tell you how you can get your hands on a brand new PentaHarp courtesy of Hohner themselves and their generous UK distributers Sutherland Trading. This offer is open to all global participants but if you happen win and live in one of the many regions where the PentaHarp is still not available then you'll have the only PentaHarp for miles around for weeks or even months before anyone else.

We're going to be using Harp Guru for this lesson. As a guitar player you might never have heard of Harp Guru, and you might have never seen even a non-interactive version
of the layout charts that Harp Guru has taken to the next level. But as a guitar player you probably do understand the power of visualisation so let's start with a quick
orientation of what we're' looking at.

Every hole on a harmonica has 2 reeds. A blow reed and a draw reed. Those reeds are represented here on the harpface as the cells inside this grey box. We have 10 holes on the
harmonica so we have 10 pairs of holes inside this grey box. So if you blow on hole 1 you will hear a C, and if you draw (which is what we call inhaling) then you will hear a D#,
otherwise known as Eb. The notes above and below the grey box can only be played with special techniques called bending and overblowing. You'll soon be interested to know how to
get the bends at least, but let's ignore them and the overblows (which are much harder) entirely. As a beginner harmonica player you'll want to know what you can do without such mysterious techniques. And there's a lot! So pay attention.

All harmonica's are tweaked to be particularly good at some things, and for the pentaharp this is making melodies, specifically with the pentatonic scales and the blues scale.
That's not to say that you can't play chords, but your first job as a PentaHarp player is to learn how to play single notes. There's a lot of help on YouTube which applies to the
PentaHarp the same as any other harmonica. Today we'll so you how much melody making you can pull of with just that one technique alone.

In Harp Guru we identify the notes of a scale by highlighting the relevant harp face cells in colour. So on hole 1 we can play the root note which is always green which is a C
by blowing, we can then play the flat 3 which is orange and plays an Eb by drawing on hole 1 as we saw before. If we repeat that blow draw pattern up one hole then we will
hear the 4th and then the 5b on hole2, and then up again 1 hole we will hear the 5th and the 7b on hole 3, and then that gives us all the notes of the blues scale.

By way of comparison, let's just quickly look at a standard Richter tuned harmonica, playing the blues scale the way it most commonly is, to see why the PentaHarp represents a
much lower barrier of entry for you. The first thing you might notice is that there is a lot of variance between the pattern used to play the same scale in the different registers of the harmonica. The pentaharp is giving us a much more regular pattern. The next thing is you can see how many of the notes of the blues scale fall outside the home row. That means that you need to be able to bend or overblow to play these notes. This is the most common way to play this scale on a Richter tuned harp. It's not easy. It has it's own benefits, but being easy is not one of them.

There is a deeper level of complexity in the Richter tuned harmonica too. You see how down here the blow reed is always lower than the draw reed (6 is lower than 7b, 1 is lower than 2), but up here the blow reed is *higher* than the draw reed (4 is higher than 3, 6 is higher than 5). That means that playing at the top of the harmonica is different in many ways to playing lower down. Notice down here we've got two identical notes right next to each other too. All of this stuff is the result of wonderful engineering, it's fascinating to understand and amazingly rich in what it can produce. But it's not easy!
