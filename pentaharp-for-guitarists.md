The PentaHarp is still causing lots of discussion and confusion, not least amongst one of the largest target groups, that is guitar players who want to incorporate harmonica
in to their sound without needing to learn all the techniques and irregularities. In this video we'll see exactly what the PentaHarp is trying to make available as low hanging
fruit, see exactly why that stuff is so much simpler on a PentaHarp than on a regular Richter tuned harp, and then at the end I'll tell you how you can get your hands on a brand
new PentaHarp courtesy of Hohner themselves and their generous UK distributers Sutherland Trading. This offer is open to all global participants but if you happen win and live
in one of the many regions where the PentaHarp is still not available then you'll have the only PentaHarp for miles around for weeks or even months before anyone else.

Every good lesson needs a good tool, and to show you what you can do with the PentaHarp we'll be using Harp Guru. And as self-proclaimed "not a theory guys" Ronnie Shellist says
this is a very powerful tool for .... (I think this stuff should actually go in the other video).

So let's jump in with a quick definition of what we're looking at.

Every hole on a harmonica has 2 reeds. A blow reed and a draw reed. Those reeds are represented here on the harpface as the cells inside this grey box. We have 10 holes on the
harmonica so we have 10 pairs of holes inside this grey box. So if you blow on hole 1 you will hear a C, and if you draw (which is what we call inhaling) then you will hear a D#,
otherwise known as Eb. The notes above and below the grey box can only be played with special techniques called bending and overblowing. You'll soon be interested to know how to
get the bends at least, but let's ignore them and the overblows (which are much harder). As a beginner harmonica player you'll want to know what you can do without such mysterious
techniques. And there's a lot! So pay attention.

All harmonica's are tweaked to be particularly good at some things, and for the pentaharp this is melody making. That's not to say that you can't play chords, but your first
job as a PentaHarp player is to learn how to play single notes. There's a lot of help on YouTube which applies to the PentaHarp the same as any other harmonica. Today we'll
so you how much melody making you can pull of with just that one technique alone.

In Harp Guru we identify the notes of a scale by highlighting the relevant harp face cells in colour. So on hole 1 we can play the root note which is always green which is a C
by blowing, we can then play the flat 3 which is orange and plays an Eb by drawing on hole 1 as we saw before. If we repeat that blow draw pattern up one hole then we will
hear the 4th and then the 5b on hole2, and then up again 1 hole we will hear the 5th and the 7b on hole 3, and then that gives us all the notes of the blues scale.

By way of comparison, let's just quickly look at a standard Richter tuned harmonica, playing the blues scale the way it most commonly is, to see why the PentaHarp represents a
much lower barrier of entry for you.
