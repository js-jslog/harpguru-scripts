The relationship between the key of harp you're playing, the position you're playing in and the key of the song/ tune/ melody/ or noise you end up making is a very useful thing to understand. If you don't understand it yet then you'll want some help with that. And if you do understand it then you'll realise that sometimes it can be better to have a little support on the thing you already know to help you focus on the thing you don't.

Well we've got harp guru for all of that. First we'll look at how the relationships are modelled and the basics of controlling them. Then we'll look at some applications of this knowledge where harpguru can help you transpose riffs, discover positional playing without intimidation, break down and understand the magic behind your favourite riffs, help you squeeze everything you can from the harps you have and convince you to buy more harps! Warning: harpguru might make you want to buy more harps.

We're just going to jump straight in to something ok. If you've ever heard of keys and positions then you'll be fine. If not then you might need to do a little research first.

If you play a C harmonica in first position, then you are playing in the key of C. And if you play a C harmonica in second position then you are playing in the key of G. These are two facts which you will learn early on in your harmonica studies. Why these are true is something we'll come to understand soon, but let's just start with those assumptions. Knowing that, and with a little explanation, perhaps, it's clear what this menu is showing us. It's telling us for a C harmonica what key we'll be playing in in each position, and it's also telling us which of the options is currently selected, both on the menu scroller, and in the labels just in case the selection is offscreen. First is C, second is G, 9th is Ab, and you can see as I select these options, something is changing on the harpface in the background. I've only highlighted the root note here and as you can see, when I change position, from first to second, it's location is moving from the 1 hole blow to the 2 hole draw. Let's look at the harp face and look a little closer.

We've currently got the harp face labelled with scale degrees, 1,2,3,4,5 etc, root note (1) on the 1 hole blow, and the pitches identified down the left hand legend, which starts on the root note which here is C. We can swap these around so that the pitches are on the harp face and the degree's are listed in the left hand legend. So, now the 1 hole blow is labelled as C. Playing in C on a C harmonica, remember is first position. Now remember what the root note of second position was, it was G, and where do we find G? On the 2 hole draw, which is exactly where we saw our root note move to when we were playing with the options in this menu.

So that's how you use harp guru to see how position and song key vary together. But what if you don't know which harp you're going to use. What if all you know is that you'll be playing second position? Well if you make sure that second position is selected here, then when you come to the next menu you will be shown which harp's you'll need to play in second position to achieve any song key. So in second position, if you want to play in the key of F then you will need a Bb harp, and if you use a C harp you'll be playing in G, as we already know.

And again, you can do the same with song key as your unchanging option. If the song you're playing along to is G then you can either use a Bb harp in 4th, a B in 9th a C in 2nd etc. And if the song changes to an A then you can just go back to the previous menu to choose the song in A, and come back here to see that all the options here now show you how to play a song in A.

So far so good? It's not the most simple idea this, so it's not surprising that the tool might appear a little confusing at first, but what we've just been through in a couple of minutes is all you need to know for the basics, and with the basics you'll be able to do all of the following:


If you only have one harp and you want to play along to a tune in a key, well there's a position for that, and you can find it with 3 taps on your phone screen.

If your friend can only accompany you in one key but you're bored of jamming in the same position every night, then you can play a new harp in a different position and make both of yourselves happy.

If you refuse to playin anything other than 2nd position but you want to use all of your harps, then you'll be wanting to know which key each one will be producing.


Now it's totally possible to do all of those things in your head and I'd dare to say that everyone is at least capable of memorising this logic for 1st 2nd & 3rd position in C, G, D, A & E. While you're learning harpguru will support you, but even when you've got it there are huge benefits in applying this tool not only for the keys and positions you haven't learned yet, but also to give you enough headspace to focus your attention on new ideas which would otherwise become sidetracked with mental visualisation challenges. Ideas like, "I wonder if this riff can be played in another position". It's very good to be able to do that in your head and you should practice it, but sometimes it's just not the interesting problem at hand. Harp guru's benefit is it's ability to help you focus on your goals, whatever they are.


So let's see some examples of the type of thing we might want to do. We're going to move pretty quickly here but if I haven't already made a video on any of these subjects in more detail, all you have to do is ask.

Let's start with that example of transposing riffs, and let's start with a popular riff, this smoke on the water by deep purple. ..... that's something that lot's of people learn, and they usually learn it in second position, because, why not it's classic 2nd position isn't it. Now it's not the most complex riff, but it's not the most simple either, it's got 4 notes, that's more than half a standard scale. Would you like to take a guess how many other positions that riff can be played in? How many of those do you think it's at least as easy as playing in second position. Would you like to rack your mind figuring it out or would you just like to do this.

Come to the keys and position menu, let's say we want to play all of these riffs on the same harmonica, let's just say C to make it easy, so each riff will be in a different key, now you can see in the background on the harpface that as I'm changing position the riffs scale degrees are moving around the harp face. Let's look at these. Let's start in 3rd position. Arguably that's easier in the middle register and it's doable in the lower register if you can do some deep bends. 4th position, all you need is an 8 hole blow bend. 5th, certainly available to intermediate players in the lower and upper registers, 6th, how easy is that, and how exactly as easy is that. Even 7th 8th and 9th have their intermediate options. All positions considered, only 10th and 11th *require* an overblow or an overdraw in all registers. And *knowing* that for a fact has just taken 30 seconds. So if you are looking to do some kind of Westlife inspired endless 5th step key change parody then you can find your confidence in planning that out with harp guru. And you don't need to feel bad that you couldn't visualise all of those positions in your mind.

So what if we wanted to do the same thing, but we actually wanted to play along to the recording which is in G. Well remember what we learned before. That means that we want to make sure we've selected G as the song key and then go to the part of the menu where the song key is fixed, and we can see that as we move through all of the positions we will see the same thing happening to the harp face as we saw before. The key difference this time is that we don't see the root pitch changing in the left hand legend, and that's because harpguru is changing the harp key to make sure that the root note of each position is always G since that's the key of the song we're playing in. So now if you *need* to play smoke on the water in G, but you only have a Db harp, well now you know that it can still be done.

Here's a situation I find myself in sometimes. I've read a melody from a transcript and I just want to know whether I can play all the notes together on a harp. Well let's just start with an odd key harp let's say Ab, and punch in the notes for a very not odd melody, say C, E, G. Surely there must be a better way. Well yes watch this, because we now have the notes on the harpface rather than the scale degrees, harpguru will prioritise maintaining these notes while we flick through harp keys and positions, looking for a setup where these notes are easy to play. And it should be no surprise that we find that C E and G are easily playable on a C harp. Now here, position and song key are kind of irrelevant. We've found a harp that will handle it. If we find out that the song is actually in Gb then we can either recognise that we're going to be playing this thing in 7th position on the C harp, or we can go back to searching through positions which we know better, until we realise that playing C E & G over a song in Gb is a little strange. In any case you can see that changing position and song key here has no effect on the note which are being played, just the *meaning* or *value* of these notes in the different contexts. See how the scale degrees they represent is changing in the left hand legend.

This leads on nicely to one of my faviourite things to do with harpguru which is to get a better appreciation of the relationship between the positions and keys, and the context of notes being played as the positions and keys change. A simple example is to see how the roots move around through the positions. If you add in the 5th too you can see that the 5th in one position is the root in the next. 5th on 2 hole draw in 1st is root in second. 5th on 4 hole draw in second is root in 3rd. And so on. We can also use this to understand why some notes work over all the chord changes and some only work on one or two. This application really is incredibly powerful and you can find some dedicated videos on that subject and I'll most definitely be doing more.

This last demonstration is very instructive. If you've ever tried to get your head around modes of the major scale you might enjoy this. Let's higlight the notes of the major scale in 1st position... first position... major scale, ok! Now let's keep those same notes highlighted while we change position by leaving the notes on the harpface. As we change position we can see that the very same notes are making up different scales which are being flashed to us as we change the settings. Really cool way to get your head around this concept. Not to mention the fact that you can select scales from the scales menu and then see how managable it is in your favourite positions. Look at that. No one ever talks about the blues scale in 5th position do they, but *that* is definitely a thing, and if you think that you will never use 5th position then you just haven't got harp guru yet.



So that's how to control keys and positions in harp guru in a nutshell with some ideas to inspire you in to explorations all of your own. We've only scratched the surface here, so if you want to give it a go yourself you can download harp guru for both android and iOS, and if you want to request video content on any specific question then all you have to do is ask. I'll be back with more demonstrations, tips, lessons and revolations in more videos soon so please like and subscribe. It's good for both of us.









Well plug them in and search. If we setup the harpface to present pitches rather than degrees then something very special happens when we search through our settings. So currently we're playing 



Make a video talking about why the turnaround offers points of interest by allowing you to use notes that you aren't able to use in the other chords.










Today we're going to look at all of the ways that we can play with position & key, how they effect each other, and what these changes do to the context of the notes being played using Harp Guru.

So first of all let's get 4 things defined:

Harp key - thats the key of the harp, obviously. Specifically it's the root note when the harp is played in 1st position. The pitch of the 1 hole blow. Here we're looking at a C harp.

Position - you know this. 1st position, 2nd position... 12th position hmm? This is the note that we're using as our root note. If you're playing a scale

Song key - we've just seen above that 

If any of that is new to you then you might have some research to do before you can really benefit from what we'll cover here. But perhaps this is going to explain everything for you.



The basics - explain that we have 3 things here and when we change one one stays the same and the other is updated 

But modifying these properties is the x not the y. What we want to do now is apply this tool to solve some problems and explore interesting ideas. So here we go.

Transposing riffs between chord changed
Finding options for playing known
Discover the scales in each position, or find the position to play a given scale
- playing songs with different scales at their core can be a really easy way to mix up your style, and depending on what position you want to 
Visualise the relationships between positions (watch the root move around)
