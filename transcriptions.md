Harp tab is a popular alternative for musical notation, and it's no wonder. Learning the note layout on a single harmonica is hard enough, let alone doing that 12 times. But what happens when the tab isn't available, or we feel like it's not quite right, or we already know a tune on a piano for instance and just want to map that knowledge to the harmonica, or we just want to get a better musical appreciation of what we're playing?

Today we're going to use harp guru to transcribe the iconic riff to Californication by the Red Hot Chilli Peppers from *this*. We're going to end up with multiple options, all with their own benefits and drawbacks, and it's going to be a piece of cake.

To do this, all you'll need is a basic understanding of how to read notes from a musical stave, and the harp guru app which is available in the android play store right now.

Ok, first step, what are we actually looking at? This is a musical stave representing both the guitar melody and bass harmony. Guitar is on the top stave and bass is on the bottom. We don't really need to know that, but if you're in any doubt about what you want to play then most likely it is the melody from the top stave. The bottom stave can also contain melody as we'll see later, or you might even just want to try and include the harmony parts to accompany yourself as a badass brass and steel weilding guru in your own right.

Let's start simple and just play the main melodic line of the first bar which is A, E, B, C. How can we play that combination of notes on a harmonica? Harp Guru can help! Just open up harp guru, tell it which notes you want to play and then have a look at what you've got. We'll be looking at major diatonic harmonicas today, but Harp Guru models a number of alternate tunings too which this process applies equally well to.

Here we happen to be looking at a C harmonica in 1st position (the C is the root pitch), and all these notes are readily available to us, which is a good sign. We don't actually need to think about positions at all at this point. So put that out your mind if it's a distraction to you. We'll bring it in to the equation only once it's relevant. For now, all that's important is that this is a C harmonica.

It really doesn't matter which hamonica you have started with, the important thing is that you get your notes input. Then you can sweep through all of the available harp keys to see which ones could play these notes most easily.

Let's demonstrate by starting off with a different harmonica key. I've prepared a blank Gb harmonica on the next page so let's take a look at that and leave this one in place as it is.

This is a Gb harmonica. If we put A, E, B & C in to this then we see that we'd need to give Howard Levey a call to hit most of these notes. This is why we've got Harp Guru. Simply head to this menu and start moving through the harmonica keys. We can choose to lock either the position or the root pitch for this process. I'd suggest locking root pitch so that C stays as our root since I think it makes the translations were about to go through just a little easier to follow. I'll be making a video soon to visualise how these 3 properties vary in relation to one another, but for now, don't get distracted if there's any uncertainty here, just lock the root pitch and let's continue.

You can see that the location of our selected notes are moving around as we select different harmonicas which only makes sense when you think about it doesn't it. C is not in the same place on a C harp to on a D harp, and that is true throughout the range of keys.

G looks like it's standard enough even if there are a couple of bends in the lower octave so let's note that down. Continuing on, A looks ok except for the C which is on these overblow and blow bend holes, so let's discount that. Continuing on you can see our notes moving around as discussed. C looks good as we've already seen on our first page. And F *could* be ok, but again we've got some blow bends so to keep things really simple let's discount that now too.

That leaves us with C and G. We've already got C setup on the other page so let's setup G here and see how they compare. Remember our melody is A, E, B, C all ascending, so on the G harp we actually have 2 options. One starting from the 1 hole draw, and the other starting from the 4 hole draw.

The 4 hole draw option has no bends (4draw, 6draw, 8blow, 9draw) so let's go with that.

And over on the C harp we also have two options, 1 starting on the 3 hole full step bend and the other starting on the 6 hole draw. I fancy the 3 full bend over the 10 blow bend we would need to hit to get the B if we started on the 6 draw, so I'll start on the 3 hole which will be 3draw full bend, 5blow, 7draw, 7blow. You can see already that Harp Guru is constantly shoving options in our face which wouldn't be obvious to most of us usually.

Let's see how each of them sound, starting with the C harp.

And now the G.

All the notes are the same pitch! Coincidentially enough they are even in the same octave which wasn't guaranteed to happen given that we had multiple options of each harp.

So which to use? Well that depends on a *lot* of factors, which we'll get in to. But the most important factor is what are all the other notes we're going to need to play. There is a second part to this riff afterall. Looking back at the stave we can read that it is F, C, G, A. We already have C and A from our previous phrase so let's add F & G to the mix.

For the C harp we see these notes fit in quite nicely so this still looks like a candidate. The G harp can of course service the addition of a G, and while we might get nervous about the overblow and the blow bended F's here, if we remember that F is actually the first note in this second ascending phrase then we can rest easy that it will be the low F on the 3 hole half step which we'll be playing which is less of a concern.

Let's see how these sound when put together. First the C harp.

And now the G.

So both are still equally viable, and that's a good thing. Perhpas you don't have a G harp for example. I do favour the G harp though and I'll tell you for why.

The californication riff isn't complete with the little bassline flourish which happens between the phrases we've already figured out. It's this bit in the musical notation, and it's made up of a quick movement between E & D, followed by a C, and it sounds like this.

On the G harmonica the E and the D are on the same hole (the 6), so even though we need to control our diaphram to change our breath direction quickly, we don't need to also think about changing holes. On the C, the E is on the 5 hole and the D is on the 4 hole, *and* we need to change our breath direction, so this is significantly more diffiult.

The dream would be able to do a proper trill there wouldn't it, changing holes without changing breath direction. Perhaps that's possible, and perhaps we'll talk about that in part 2 of this demonstration of using harp guru for transcription.

In part 2 we'll also show how we can bring positions in to the conversation to supercharge this process. Notice that we've been able to do all of this today without putting any thought at all in to position and song key.

I hope you're looking forward to that, there's a great deal of power here, and I hope this video has proved how much of it is available without too much musical knowledge, but also that this is a great way to help you actually acquire some musical knowledge whilst playing harmonica if that's something you want to pursue. We all love this instrument, but without a little help, it can obscure that goal from us.

Bass line second position on G

Do a simple introduction in first position showing that we can easily get something
which works has the right notes in it, but we want more than that.

We want to capture:
1. Nice to have the key notes on draws so we can add texture if we want
2. The pitch range of the melody - actually happens over multiple
3. The pulloff technique sound of the bassline riff

We can see that we have a minor 3rd. From the positions video we know that there are only a couple of positions which natively make this interal easibly available .

Or we could take the approach of starting with all the notes figuring out which note is the root pitch, switching to that and then seeing the scale pop up. Then modifying so that the appropriate position is selected.

Start in first position
Twelth position on A
The problem with this though is that it's really hard to reproduce the sound
of the pulloff technique on a harmonica if you're changing direction of airflow

So if we want to get that sounds then we need to try other positions
The only place where a 3rd and a second are next to each other in the middle register

Don't move from notes to degrees *too* early, but do far enough before the end that
we can finish the more complex examples in degree mode.

Talk about the chords too
Even though it's written in C, if we think about the parts of this which make up the
bassline and listen to the tone we can either take the ACE of the bassline to be
like a cmajor chord with a 6 instead of a 5, which you'd need to talk to someone
with a better music education than me to understand the meaning of, or we can take
it to be a fully qualified A minor triad. If you listen to the tune you can tell it's
clearly in a minor key. The 

Also, now that we've got what we *wanted* we can start looking for things that we
didn't think we wanted. Like double stops which might be able to add something.


And that flash notification there has just informed us that in highlighting that D we are now using all the notes of the C major scale, which is true. That's not to say that the song is actually in C major, later on we'll discover that it's actually in it's relative minor, A. As befor, HarpGuru doesn't *need you* to care about song key to get results here, but if *you* do care, then it's going to help you out. Let's put that asside again though and come back to it in part 2.
