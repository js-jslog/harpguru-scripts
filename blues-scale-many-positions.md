A taste of positional playing (WITHOUT the headache)

Playing in positions other than 1st 2nd and 3rd can seem like a massive reeducation. You'll have to learn new scales to play along to genres of music you're not really interested in, right?

Wrong! And while it's most likely that you will want to invest most of your time mastering the more popular positions, there is a lot of insight to gain from just getting a taste of playing in other positions.

And today we're going to see just how accessible and familar that insight and experience can be using the explorative power of Harp Guru.

So how's this going to work? What we'll do is take a scale that many of us are already familiar with, the blues scale. If you aren't familiar then take a look in the description for my visual introduction.

Assuming that you are proficient enough with bends and blowbends to play the blues scale in second position, we're going to see how many positions we can play our familiar blues scale in.

We won't require any overblows or overdraws for this. If you have all the overblows and overdraws already then you know you can play any scale in any position. What we want to prove today is that intermediate and even beginner players can stay in their comfort zone, but still get a worthwile insight in to positional playing.

So let's get started. Here's the blues scale in second position. We can't play all the notes. We've got the important 3b & 5b's on overblow and overdraw holes here, but we've got those notes available elsewhere, and we've even got a complete scale available down here, so we're happy.

How about 3rd position? Well the situation is even better isn't it. only this 5b on hole 9 is on an overdraw. The rest is beautiful. You might even be surprised to see the blues scale in 3rd position like this. It definitely doesn't get as much coverage as 2nd. Well if that surprised you then just wait for what happens next.

4th position? Not bad. These 5b's are on overblows, but this one isn't so we have a complete scale. And even in the lower octave, without the 5b we have the minor pentatonic don't we, so that's all good.

How about 5th position? Excellent again. Only this 5b is unplayable and we have a complete scale down here.

6th position? One missing 5th here, but look at the layout of these notes. So many draws, which Will Wilde would be happy about. Lots of power and passion. And look at this chord we have here. This is a diminished chord, and we have it in 2 octaves, and if we are really clever we might even be able to play a diminished 7 chord.. I'll leave that to the likes of Alex Paclin to experiment with.

Moving on to 7th. This is our first position where the root note isn't unbent. We're leaving the realms which people associate with the modes of the major scale. All the other positions up until now are often advertised (quite rightly) as being associated with certain modes because those modes are played without any bent notes.

What we talk about less is that if you're willing to bend then you've got more freedom to pick the scale that you play in any position. Not total freedom for most of us, but we've got this far with just a single scale haven't we.

And sure enough, look, 7th position has an eminently playable blues scale right here. We can't play the root above it or the 2 5ths above that, but that's comparible to our limitations in 2nd position isn't it.

8th position. Now we're having to put in some work. But we still do have a complete scale here and more than enough to play with higher up.

9th position. You can see that one by one these notes are leaving the unbent holes and finding their way to the bent ones, which makes it more difficult to play this scale accurately. We're definitely in challenging territory here, but there's no reason we couldn't put together a few riffs down here.

10th. Woof. Only the 5b remaining on the unbent holes. But that's the most important note right?! You could argue that, but not having a root note accessible until you get up to the 8 blowbend is definitely a drag.

11th. Well we didn't expect too much here did we. But if you're really tight with those bends you have an octave and a half here where only the 4 is missing. I'm reaching I know.

12th. Perhaps surprising to some, 12th not holding up as well as it often can. But we're only technically missing the 7b in the lower octave and the 4 in the middle octave.

And back to 1st. Some might associate 1st with missing the 3b, but actually we don have a complete blues scale for us in the upper register.

So of the 12 positions we have a complete blues scale playable with only bends and blowbends in at least one octave in 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, 6th, 7th, & 8th. 1 through 8, of 12. I think that should be a surprise to many people.

So it's clear that lots of these positions are perfectly playable if you can already play the blues scale in 2nd position. In fact many of them have fewer missing notes on the overblows and overdraws.

More notes doesn't mean better of course and there are things in second position that you won't be able to do in other positions. In second position we can scoop the 5b and the 3b because they are on bent notes. You can't do that in all the positions. In second position you can play the 5b & 7b doublestop, with a scoop up to 5 7b doublestop which you can't do in all the positions and is a candidate for the most blues harmonica sound possible.

But you will discover things in other positions that you can't do in second position, and some of those sounds might be new candidates for the bluesiest sound on a harmonica. Like scooping all the way up from the 4 to the 5 in 5th position, or the diminished chord in 6th position. And once you realise that, you have just realised one of the main reasons that positional playing exists and one of the gorgeous things about the harmonica.
