A taste of positional playing (WITHOUT the headache)

Blues scale in 8 positions?!
Without overblows / overdraws

Playing in new positions can seem like a massive reeducation. You'll have to learn new scales to play along to genres of music you're not really interested in, right?

Wrong! And while it's important to focus most of your attention where you will get the most benefit (probably 2nd position for many), there is a lot of insight to gain from an accessible taste of playing in other positions.

And today we're going to see just how accessible and familar that insight and experience can be using the explorative power of Harp Guru.

Harp Guru is available in the Android and iOS stores now and was recently described in a 5* review as "an abacus for scales" "it dramatically speeds up your learning and makes it much more enjoyable", and thats exactly what we're going to demonstrate right now.

So how's this going to work? What we'll do is take a scale that many of us are already familiar with, the blues scale. If you aren't familiar then take a look in the description for a link to my visual introduction in another video.

Assuming that you are proficient enough with bends and blowbends to play the blues scale in second position, we're going to see how many other positions we can play our familiar blues scale in. I'm sure you'll be surprised and excited to try some of them out.

We won't require any overblows or overdraws for this. If you have all the overblows and overdraws already then you know you can play any scale in any position. What we want to prove today is that intermediate and even beginner players can stay in their comfort zone, but still get a worthwile insight in to positional playing.

So let's get started. Here's the blues scale in second position. We can't play all the notes. We've got the important 3b & 5b's on holes 6 7 & 10 as overblow and overdraws, but we've got those notes available elsewhere on holes 3, 4 & 10, and we've even got a complete scale available down here, so we're happy.

How about 3rd position? Well the situation is even better isn't it. only this 5b on hole 9 is on an overdraw. The rest is beautiful. You might even be surprised to see the blues scale in 3rd position like this. It definitely doesn't get as much coverage as 2nd. Well if that surprised you then just wait for what happens next.

Here's 4th position? Not bad. These 1 & 4 hole 5b's are on overblows, but this one on hole 8 is just a blowbend so we have a complete scale in one octave which is no worse than second position. And even in the lower octave, without the 5b we have the minor pentatonic don't we, so this is definitely playable.

How about 5th position? Excellent again. Only this 6 hole 5b is unplayable to us without the ability to overblow, we have a complete scale down here and we're only missing the 7b up top.

6th position? One missing 5th here on hole 5, but look at the layout of these notes. So many draws, which Will Wilde & Brendan Power would be happy about. Lots of power and passion. And look at this chord we have here. This is a diminished chord, and we have it in 2 octaves, and if we are really clever we might even be able to play a diminished 7 chord.. I'll leave that to the likes of Alex Paclin to experiment with.

Moving on to 7th. This is our first position where the root note isn't unbent. We're leaving the realms which people associate with the modes of the major scale. All the other positions up until now are often advertised (quite rightly) as being associated with certain modes because those modes are played without any bent notes.

What we talk about less is that if you're willing to bend then you've got more freedom to pick the scale that you play, in any position. Not total freedom for most of us, but we've got this far with the same scale in all these positions haven't we.

And sure enough, look, 7th position has an eminently playable blues scale right here. We can't play the root above it on hole 5 or the 2 5ths above that on holes 7 & 10, but that's comparible to our limitations in 2nd position isn't it.

8th position. Now we're having to put in some work. But we still do have a complete scale here and more than enough to play with higher up, although when you don't have access to the root and the 5th as we're missing on holes 7 9 & 10, you're going to noitce, even though the real colour tones of the flat 3 5 & 7 are there.

9th position. You can see that one by one these notes are leaving the unbent holes and finding their way to the bent ones, which makes it more difficult to play this scale accurately. We're definitely in challenging territory here, but there's no reason we couldn't put together a few riffs down here in the lower octave.

10th. Woof. Only the 5b remaining as an unbent note. But that's the most important note right?! You could argue that, but not having a root note accessible until you get up to the 8 blowbend is definitely a drag.

11th. Well we didn't expect too much here did we. But if you're really tight with those bends you have an octave and a half here where only the 4 is missing. I'm reaching I know.

12th. Perhaps surprising to some, 12th not holding up as well as it often can. But we're technically only missing the 7b in the lower octave and the 4 in the middle octave.

And back to 1st. Some might associate 1st with missing the 3b on the 1 & 4 hole overblows, but actually we do have a complete blues scale for us in the upper register where only blowbends are required.

So of the 12 positions we have a complete blues scale playable with only bends and blowbends in at least one octave in 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, 6th, 7th, & 8th. 1 through 8, of 12. I think that will come as a surprise to many people.

So it's clear that lots of these positions are perfectly playable if you can already play the blues scale in 2nd position. In fact many of them have fewer missing notes on the overblows and overdraws.

More notes doesn't mean better of course and there are things in second position that you won't be able to do in other positions. In second position you can play the 5b & 7b doublestop, with a scoop up to 5 7b doublestop which is a candidate for the most blues harmonica sound possible. You can't do that in 3rd position for example because the 7b is on a blow and the 5s are on draws, you see.

But you will discover things in other positions that you can't do in second position, and some of those sounds might be new candidates for the most blues harmonica sound possible. Like scooping all the way up from the 4 to the 5 on hole 3 in 5th position, or the diminished chords we mentioned in 6th position. And once you realise that, you have just realised one of the main reasons that positional playing exists and one of the gorgeous things about the harmonica, and that's where the value lies. In this understanding and appreciation.

So what do you think? How many positions can you play the blues scale in? Why not give it a go.

And if you're thinking, well I've got a melody maker tuned harp. Can I play a blues scale in 6th position on that. Sure you can! And you can experiment with all the scales on all the tunings in all the positions with Harp Guru. If there is a scale or tuning we've not got then that can be fixed. Just get in touch.

Harp Guru is available in the iOS and android stores now, waiting to help you demystify all of your harmonicas.
