Relative keys are a concept which deserves some detailed and deliberate description. That's not what we're doing here. What I want to show you very quickly today is a situation which I know happens to lot's of people, and how relative keys are at the centre, making sense of a very disorientating experience.

We're using Harp Guru to demonstrate what's going on here, so if you don't know what relative keys are yet then stick around anyway. Harp Guru has a habit of making things very clear.

Here's what happened; I was preparing to do a little improv. I put on a jam track in G, I picked up my C harp and began simply with a major pentatonic in second position.

Strange I thought, the 3 is sounding dud, so I flattened it, and infact found that the minor pentatonic was sounding and working a lot better than the major.

Strange I thought, I'm sure this tune was in G major, why would the major pentatonic sound so bad and the minor good, and in fact not sound minor at all.

Next thing I know, I'm realising that my harp is in the key of A rather than the key of C. Ooo this is very Strange I thought! That means I'm playing an E minor pentatonic over a G major backing track. I wonder what is going on.

Well, if you *do* know of relative keys then you might know that Eminor is the relative key of G major. What that means here is that all of the notes in this Eminor pentatonic are exactly the same as those in the G major pentatonic. Knowing that is one thing, but what does it *look like*, and how can we feel it.

First let's have a look at the notes we're playing in this Eminor pentatonic. E, G, A, B, D making up the Root, flat3, 4th, 5th and flat7 of a minor pentatonic (shall I mention the characteristic 3 half tone points?)

In the positions and keys menu we can see all the positions required to play every key on this A harp we've found ourselves with. And down here we can see that playing in G on an A harmonica is possible in 11th position. Is it possible that I was playing 11th position... by accident?

Well yes apparently it was, but I'm no wizard, watch this.. when we select 11th position suddenly we're told that we're playing a major pentatonic. So what's happened here? Well looking at the harpface we can see that we're still playing E, G, A, B & D, but now with the G as the root and the remaining notes forming the 2nd, 3rd, 5th & 6th this is now a major pentatonic.

So the pattern that we're familiar with playing for a minor pentatonic in second position is exactly the same as for a major pentatonic in 11th position. And this is the case with all the patterns we know.

Here's a major pentatonic in second position, and here's the same pattern creating a minor pentatonic in 5th position.

And here's a major pentatonic in 1st position, creating a minor pentatonic in 4th position.

We're all familiar with a minor pentatonic in 3rd position. Well here's the same pattern producing a minor pentatonic in 12th position.

This isn't particular to pentatonic scales either, but as I said we'll save a detailed explanation of relative keys for another video. The lesson here, apart from the fact that I have a tin ear and didn't notice that I was playing a major 6th where I thnought I was playing the root, the main lesson is to recognise that all the patterns we play have entirely different, but sometimes entirely familiar alter egos in different positions. Simply by playing the same notes using a different one as the root, we get a different scale. And that is why sometimes you can pick up the wrong harmonica and still do something great using something familiar, and why when you are ready to try, you might be more well prepared for new positions than you think you are.

The details of this 

In the positions and keys menu we will change the harp key to A since that's *is* what it turned out I was playing, we'll fix the position at 2nd for the moment since that's what I *thought* I was playing, and we'll see confirmation here that yes, second position on an A harp *should* be the key of E.

But I wasn't playing in E, I was playing in G, which must have meant I was accidentally playing in 11th position. Well how on earth could I accidentally do something as epic as that. The answer is simple once you *see* it.

Here are all the notes which make up a minor pentatonic in second position on an A harp (E, G, A, B, D). Keeping the harp and the notes being played the same, we can see that as we change position, the resulting song key is changing, and the function of each note is changing too. In second position the 2 hole draw was the root note, but now it's a flat 2 (but now it's a flat 5), and by the time we get to 11th position, it's now the major 6th and the 3hole halfstep is the root.

And notice that while none of the notes have changed (E, G, A, B, D), the fact that the root is now G rather than E means that the scale is now a G major rather than an E minor.

Now obviously there is a lot more to describe when it comes to relative keys, and we'll certainly be having more details and deliberate discussions on the subject in other videos. Here I wanted to demystify an odd experience that I'm sure a lot of us have had and show that the patterns we learn on the harmonica have strange and interesting behaviours which can all be explained and visualised with a little help from harp guru.

Isn't that interesting, and isn't it clearer with some interactive visualisation.
