If you've come to the harmonica to learn the blues then the blues scale is something you're going to discover so early that you might not have even squeeked out your first bend yet.

If that's you then don't worry, there's still plenty here for you, and if you're already clued up on the blues scale and just here to get a new perspective then we've got you covered too.

We're going to be talking about the blues scale in second position today. That means that if we've got a C harp, we'll be playing in the key of G, with the 2 draw being our root note.

We'll start with the core pattern which happens between holes 2 & 6, and that's 2draw, 3draw halfstepbend, 4blow, 4draw bend, 4draw, 5draw & 6blow, and in G it'll sound like this.

Now you can see that the notes we've highlighted are available further up and down the harp in higher and lower octaves too, we'll get to that but let's just concentrate on the middle octave for now.

It's true, you do need to be able to bend to play this scale in full. And while the 3b & the 5b are really important to the full bluesy sound, they are also very easily overused, so if you can't play them yet then just think of this as a great opportunity to figure out how to be melodic and expressive without them. It's certainly possible as I'm trying to demonstrate in the background now. You might be wondering about that glissando slide down to the 1 draw. No I didn't bend the 3 draw because it's so fleeting that the precise tone is unimportant. So that's another way to get more notes politely in to your playing if you're not able to hit the 3bend yet.

Limiting the notes you use doesn't have to be forced on you either. Even for fully fledged benders, it's advisable to practice without the 5b sometimes, which happens to be the minor pentatonic, because doing so will help you be restrained with the 5b. It's a spicy ingredient the 5b so having a strategy for using it tastefully is essential.

~~Just to give you an idea of how spicy it is, have you ever heard of somehting called the tritone, or the devils interval. It's the ultra-dissonant and unnerving interval loved by black sabbeth and falsly rumoured to have been banned by the churches in medieval Europe. The devils interval is the same thing as the root to the 5b. It's called a tritone because it's composed of 3 whole tones, or 6 semitones or halfsteps depending on your dialect. You can see in the left hand legend here that from G to C# is 6 semitones. From G we move 1,2,3,4,5,6 semitones to the C#. It's actually possible to play this interval as a split in 6th position, for this to be in the key of G we'll need an Ab harp. Wooo, hear that. That's the devils interval for sure. So yes, do take care with it won't you.~~

Another reason to be proficient without the 3b & the 5b is becuase most of us won't be able to hit the 6 overblow and the 7 & 10 overdraws. And frankly, I don't practice that 10 blowbend enough either. But that doesn't mean I can't carry the tone of the blues scale up to hole 10. We just have to recognise what we do and don't have and make the most of it. Don't skimp on practicing the scale everywhere you can. Don't let missing notes stop you using what you do have. Afterall the pentatonic's are just incomplete scales in the first place aren't they!

So that's your overview I think. Here are your notes, don't worry if you can't play all of them yet, and if you can, just be tasteful about it.

There's lots more to discover, and there always will be, and if you want a guide on that journey then you should consider downloading Harp Guru. It's available on iOS and android now, and it'll help you explore and demystify all of your harps, make sense of what all of us teachers are saying on youtube, and give you some silent harp practice to do if you're the type of person who can't get your harp off of your mind but don't feel like actually cracking it out in front of all those strangers on the morning commute.

Lot's of you will be able to bend the 3 and 5 draws, but this advice is still relevant for most people because most of us can't hit the 6 overblow and the 7 & 10 overdraws. And frankly, I don't practice that 10 blowbend enough either. But that doesn't mean I can't carry the tone of the blues scale up to hole 10. We just have to recognise what we do and don't have and make the most of it.

So that's it. This visualisation has been created in Harp Guru, and we're 



The root and the 5th find their way in to most scales, because they are extremely stable. These are the first 2 notes that you will want to get really comfortable sliding to during improvisation. These are your safe notes. The 4th is unstable, not that that's a bad thing. You'll just find that you won't comfortably end phrases with it. The 4th is an important part of the 12 bar blues progression and along with the root (or I), and the 5th, be aware the the 1 4 5 chord progression is referring to these 3 notes.

The remaining 3 notes, the 3b, the 5b and the 7b are really where we get blue. If you can bend then this 5b,7b doublestop, especially resolving with a scoop up to a 5th is almost *the* blue sound of the harmonica isn't it. The 3b can be involved in a similar doublestop with the 5b. <Do I need to bring up the 3 only works if you're in a major key yet?>

So what do we have? Well we've got a root, of course, and we've got a 4th and a 5th as well. 

Because we're using Harp Guru, we can also see what the notes of this scale are.




- show it from the scales menu
- the core part to learn here happens between holes 2 and 6 and that's 2 draw (or 3 blow) 3draw half step, 4 blow, 4draw bend, 4draw, 5draw, 6blow
- there's more either side of these limits but let's come back to that
- it's got those super bluesy flat notes 3,5,7 (examples)
- if you can't bend there is still attitude to express, especially along to backing tracks
- it's all about knowing what you've got and what you don't
- on that, it's interesting to note that without the 5b this is the minor pentatonic
- this is a C harmonica in 2nd position, so this scale is being played in g and using harp guru we can see what all the notes on the scale are
- we can also see what harmonica we would need to play this scale in other keys using the positions and menu
- so what about these other holes then? Hole 1 is the same as 4. Hole 2 can be bent down to the 7b.
