Noone likes clickbait so I'll get to the point on this one.

We are looking at Richter tuning through a keyhole, and we're not seeing the full picture.

Some other parts of the picture are known to us, but by another name so the full picture
remains fragmented and confused.

Other parts are so undocumented & unexplored that this is the only description of this type
that I'm aware of. I will not be surprised to learn that there are others.

If this sounds like a conspiricy theory then that's deliberate. But what I'll show you
here won't have you questioning what you knew before so much as seeing it all with much
greater clarity.



This is why we call it the *major* diatonic. It is the ionian (or major) tuned Richter system.

After some study it's become clear to me that Richter is not a tuning so much as a tuning system
