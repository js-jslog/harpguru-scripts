# Richter offers more than anyone knows

# Intro

Richter isn't what you think it is! I mean it is what you think it is, but it's also so much more.

We've been looking at Richter tuning through a keyhole, and we're not seeing the full picture.

You will have seen other parts of the picture, but only through more keyholes so the picture
stays fragmented and confused.

Other parts are completely uncharted. So today I want to give you the full picture on Richter, the
full Richter picture, if you will and show you why it's got at least 56 other positions that you've
not even considered before. I know that doesn't sound possible. That's why it's facinating.

# The basics

For this to make sense you'll need at least a vague understanding of the modes of the major scale. What they are, how they relate to each
other, how they relate to the circle of fifths and how positions are useful tools for changing
modes on the harmonica. I've linked some resources in the description including some of my own if
you need a refresher. This video's only 5 minutes long so why not stick around and see how you go.

Something which might be well known to you already, but we can't skip over here is a definition of the Richter tuning system.
Even if you think you know this, just stick around, it'll get novel real quick.

Let's just clear down this harp face so we have a blank canvas Richter tuned harp in first position. Ok.

Richter tuning was invented to give the player 3 things:

1. A I chord triad, available all the way along the blow row
2. A V chord triad in the lower register (when we change to second position, we see that these notes are a triad chord on the V chord)
3. And returning to 1st position. A full scale available in the middle and upper register, and that's a Major or Ionian scale. (with a compromise being made on the 10 hole to prioritise the I chord triad over the availability of the 7th scale degree)

That's all they had in mind, and that's all they needed to play the absolutely banging Ionaian mode German folk music of the time. If you need more detail on what's been
said there then look to the description again for resources explaining this grounding concept. We're moving on to the revelations.

# The revelation

Now this is where history & context play their role.

Because if the music those funky Germans had been playing were in the Dorian mode rather than the Ionian mode then most likely they would have created this instead, where they achieve the same 3 things:

1. A I chord triad, available all the way along the blow row (which is now a minor triad as is appropriate for the Dorian mode)
2. A V chord triad in the lower register (which is also a minor triad because the mode of the V chord would be Aeolian which is also minor - more on this later)
3. A full dorian scale available in the middle and upper register (with the same compromise we saw before)

So the goals of the Richter system are ambivolent to the mode that you're making the tuning for, and that's why I call Richter a system rather than a tuning.
There are many tunings that you can configure using the Richter system. All of the modes of the major scale at the very least.

Which leads us to our first revolation. This is why we call our one (this one, let's go back to it on the first page where the Germans were playing Major mode music) the *major* diatonic. It is the major (or Ionian) tuned Richter system. And that's why the major diatonic we commonly know is identical to what we have listed in this Richter section as Ionian Richter. You see the layout didn't change at all.

And it's really interesting to play with these tunings to see how the modal scales are shifted relative to how you are familiar with playing them on the Ionian Richter.

What I mean by this is that we all know that 2nd position on an Ionian Richter is in the Mixolydian mode. And we also know that 3rd position on the Ionian Richter is Dorian mode. Let's go back to 1st position in the Ionian mode before making the next point.

Well on a Mixolydian Richter, where 1st position is Mixolydian (you see we wouldn't be playing the B which is a 7th scale degree anymore, we would be playing the Bb which is a
7b, making mixolydian), 12th position is Ionian, you go back down the list to Ionian, & 2nd position again moving up from Mixolydian is Dorian. Dorian is 3rd position on the Ionian Richter and 2nd position on the Mixolydian Richter, and it would of course be 1st position on the Dorian Richter. So you see the position to mode mapping is shifted up one each time.

Let's continue looking at the Dorian Richter that we setup as our hypothetical Dorian German folk instrument. If you're sharp then you'll know that in first position we can play the Dorian scale like we already have here.
And if we play the same notes in 2nd position, that's going to be the Aeolian scale, otherwise known as natural minor. It turns out that this *is* the tuning which Seydel, Lee Oscar and
most people in the harp speaking world call Natural Minor tuning because when they set it up they are only thinking about playing it in 2nd position. See again the layout hasn't changed. Let's just change it back to Dorain Richter to stay on track with the naming.

The same is the case with country tuning. Country tuning has a couple of variations but the common theme is that we want to be able to play an Ionian scale in 2nd position. Well
that's exactly what the Lydian Richter will give you. It's a big jump from Dorian to Lydian so excuse me while I tidy these up, and then we'll see that since we're already in 2nd position we're playing the Ionian (or Major) mode. Country music makes use of the flat 3 and flat 5 along with the bending we're used to in 2nd position which is why people
favour this over playing an Ionian Richter in 1st position.

And the list goes on. What I've called Mixolydian Richter here is often called Dorian cross, because people are interested in playing Dorian in 2nd
position (cross harp). You see we're still in 2nd position. And I'm not taking a shot at anyone here. Naming your tuning based on the position you're configuring it for makes a lot of sense.

But one thing is clear from all of this. Positional playing is about more than just the scales made available. And that's because musical character is about more than
just the scale you play. Each position contains textural, chordal and tonal characteristics, both opportunities and quirks. Dorian in 6th position will not sound the same as Dorain in 4th position, and this is why I love the harmonica. It's an instrument of perverted specialisation, and every perversion is it's own specialisation.

So to return to our clickbait title, that's why, if we accept that there are 8 possible tunings within the Richter system as we have here,
and 8 positions for normal people to play on each, then there are 64 unique sounds to explore within this one humble system. 56 more than the 8 max
you'd alredy discovered. And isn't that a marvelous thought.

We should all have a soft spot for Richter. It's scope has vastly outstripped it's ambition, and I hope I've shown that not only applies to the achievements
of positional playing, but also to it's unacknowledged fingerprint in the body of alternate tunings and the as yet unexplored possibilities in the numerous
permutations therein.

Richter *is not* the only system, and everything I've said here is as applicable to any other, like Spiral as we've also got in our list. But that's a meager
concession. Richter is even more ubiquitous than you knew. Even Howard Levy still has some work to do, and Richter's laughing at you and your 3 position repetoir!

I was using Harp Guru to illustrate the points made in this video. Whether you're a beginner or even a professional player, it is bound to hold the key to
demystifying some element of your harmonicas, even secrets you had no incling existed. Like what we've seen today.

And if you have any doubts about whether it's legit to move from a major to a minor triad on
The V chord as we would be doing when moving from 1st to 2nd position on this
Mixolydian tuned Richter harp, just remember that in all our I to V chord changes in
The 12 bar blues where we will typically transition from mixolydian in second position to Dorian
In 3rd position, where we can clearly see that we move from a major to a minor triad. There are
no *rules* in music, but it's reassuring to know that we've already made something work in one
context when deciding whether we think it will work in another.

So on Mixolydian Richter, playing in second position will get you a Dorian scale where as you know on an Ionian Richter you would be playing a mixolydian scale, and you
have to go one position further to 3rd to get Dorian. And while you would need to play an Ionian Richter in 12th position to play a Lydian scale, you can of course do that
in 1st position on a Lydian Richter, and you get to play Ionian (Major) in second position, which is the primary goal of what we call country tuning.

2nd position is king, but not becuase it plays
a Mixolydian scale, and all the other positions, especially 12 through to 6 where the root notes don't require overblows or overdraws have their own benefits
and quirks that give them value and reason to exist. Dorian in 6th position will not sound the same as Dorian in 4th position, because there's more to music than just scales. There's a whole video to
make on that subject but the point is unquestionable, and consequently, if we accept that the Richter system can produce 8 different tunings as we've got here,
and that there are 8 different positions that normal people can play, then that makes 64 positions and unique sounds for us to explore within the Richter tuning system
and thats 56 more than the 8 that most of us are aware of.

This is why I love the harmonica. It's such a specialised instrument, and the consequence of that is that  

Lets not pretend that people only 

is of as much interest to most people as 2nd position. But let's recognise that the isn't a 

I plan to make another video

2nd position Mixolydian is not the same thing as 3rd position Mixolydian. And that's why I say there are 56 more positions in the Richter system that you probably haven't explored.

So you can play 2nd position Mixolydian, and 3rd position

, regardless of the mode represented there. There's another video to be made explaining why 2nd position *is* the blues
and why it isn't 

Natural Minor
harps are going to be of as much interest to people looking to play the Dorian scale just because it's there. Modern harmonica playing is still predominantly interested
in the blues and when it comes to the blues, second position is king. Second position more than Mixolydian. I'll do another video explaining why that is


What I want to highlight here is that the Richter Tuning system not only means more than just a perversion
from Ionian to Mixolydian, it also means more than just the further perversion to Dorian and the other modes beyond. It in fact lays out a system with such a solid foundation that
it can be prevented in all those ways from 8 different 

# The distractions

Now this Dorian tuned Richter harp might look familiar, and that's because if you play all these notes in second position, it may now
be obvious that this is what Lee Oscar & Seydel and others call a Natural Minor tuning. Now I'm not going to pretend that I don't
understand their reasons for doing this. It much more directly says to people "hey, we know you play your blues in second position
but you'd like to have some minor chords there so here's
