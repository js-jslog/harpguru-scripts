# Intro

Noone likes clickbait so I'll get to the point. I think you'll be pleasantly surprised.

We are looking at Richter tuning through a keyhole, and we're not seeing the full picture.

We have seen other parts of the picture, but only through more keyholes so the picture
remains fragmented and confused.

Other parts are so unexplored that this video is the first time I've seen them documented
let alone related back to Richter for the full picture. The full Richter picture.

I will not be surprised to learn that there are others, and I'd love to see them.

If this sounds like a conspiricy theory then that's deliberate, actually. But what I'll show
you won't have you questioning what you knew before so much as seeing it all with much
greater clarity, so if you want to know why there are 56 more positions for you to study
on a Richter tuned harp, keep listening.

# The basics

You'll need to know about the modes of the major scale. What they are, how they relate to each
other, how they relate to the circle of fifths and how positions are useful tools for changing
modes on the harmonica. I've linked some resources in the description including some of my own if
you need a refresher.

Something which is probably well known to a lot of you, but we can't skip over here is a definition of the Richter tuning system.
Even if you think you know this, just stick around, it'll get novel real quick.

Richter tuning was invented to give the player 3 things:

1. A I chord triad, available all the way along the blow row
2. A V chord triad in the lower register
3. A full scale available in the middle and upper register (with a compromise being made on the 10 hole to prioritise the I chord triad over the availability of the 7th scale degree)

That's all they had in mind, and that's all they needed to play the absolutely banging Ionaian mode German folk music of the time.

# The revelation

And this is where history & context play their role.

If the music they had been playing were in the Dorian mode rather than the Ionian mode then most likely they would have created this instead, where they achieve the same 3 things:

1. A I chord triad, available all the way along the blow row (which is now a minor triad as is appropriate for the Dorian mode)
2. A V chord triad in the lower register (which is also a minor triad because the next mode along from Dorian is Aeolian which is also minor - more on this later)
3. A full dorian scale available in the middle and upper register (with the compromise we saw before)

So the goals of the Richter system are ambivolent to the mode that you're making the tuning for, and that's why I call Richter a system rather than a tuning.
There are many tunings that you can configure using the Richter system. All of the modes of the major scale at the very least.

This is why we call our one the *major* diatonic. It is the ionian (or major) tuned Richter system. And that's why the major diatonic we commonly know is identical
to what we have listed in this Richter section as Ionian Richter.

And it's really interesting playing with the tunings to see how the modal scales are shifted relative to how you are familiar with playing them on the Ionian Richter.

So on. Mixolydian Richter, playing on second position will get you a Dorian scale where as you know on an Ionian Richter you would be playing a mixolydian scale, and you
have to go one position further to 3rd to get Dorian. And on a Lydian...

# The distractions

Now this Dorian tuned Richter harp might look familiar, and that's because if you play all these notes in second position, it may now
be obvious that this is what Lee Oscar & Seydel and others call a Natural Minor tuning. Now I'm not going to pretend that I don't
understand their reasons for doing this. It much more directly says to people "hey, we know you play your blues in second position
but you'd like to have some minor chords there so here's 



And if you have any doubts about whether it's legit to move from a major to a minor triad on
The V chord as we would be doing when moving from 1st to 2nd position on this
Mixolydian tuned Richter harp, just remember that sure while there are no rules in
Music, we do at least know that this is common enough from all our I to V chord changes in
The 12 bar blues where we typically will transition from mixolydian in second position to Dorian
In 3rd position, where we can clearly see that a minor triad is part of the scale.
