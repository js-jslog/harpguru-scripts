# Intro

Noone likes clickbait so I'll get to the point on this one.

We are looking at Richter tuning through a keyhole, and we're not seeing the full picture.

Some other parts of the picture are known to us, but by another name so the full picture
remains fragmented and confused.

Other parts are so undocumented & unexplored that this is the only description of this type
that I'm aware of. I will not be surprised to learn that there are others.

If this sounds like a conspiricy theory then that's deliberate. But what I'll show you
here won't have you questioning what you knew before so much as seeing it all with much
greater clarity, so if you want to know why there are 56 more positions for you to study
on a Richter tuned harp, keep listening.

# The basics

We'll have to assume some knowledge of the modes of the major scale and how they apply to
your standard major diatonic richter tuned harp. If you need a primer on that then there
are *lots* of great resources some of which I'll recommend by linking in the description
including a couple of my older videos on exactly what the modes look like in the different
positions. Harp Guru is all about getting a good *look* at these otherwise difficult to
visulalise ideas.

Something which is probably just as well known to a lot of you, but is also something we
can't afford to skip here is a definition of the Richter tuning system. Even if you think
you know this, just stick around to make sure we're on the same page.

Richter tuning was invented to give the player 3 things:

1. A constantly available I chord triad, all the way along the blow row
2. A V chord triad in the lower register
3. A full scale available in the middle and upper register (with a compromise being made on the 10 hole to prioritise the I chord triad over the availability of the 7th scale degree)

That's all they had in mind, and that's all they needed to play absolutely banging German folk music at the time, which was in the Major or Ionian mode.

# The revelation

If the music they had been playing were in the Dorian mode then most likely they would have created this, where they achieve 3 things:

1. A constantly available I chord triad, all the way along the blow row (which is now a minor triad as is appropriate for the Dorian mode)
2. A V chord triad in the lower register (which is also a minor triad because the 5, 7b & 2 of the C Dorian scale is a G minor triad)
3. A full dorian scale available in the middle and upper register (with the compromise we saw before)

So the goals of the Richter system are ambivolent to the mode that you're making the tuning for, and that's why I call Richter a system rather than a tuning.
There are many tunings that you can configure using the Richter system. All of the modes of the major scale at the very least.

This is why we call our one the *major* diatonic. It is the ionian (or major) tuned Richter system.

# The distractions

Now this Dorian tuned Richter harp might look familiar, and that's because if you play all these notes in second position, it may now
be obvious that this is what Lee Oscar & Seydel and others call a Natural Minor tuning. Now I'm not going to pretend that I don't
understand their reasons for doing this. It much more directly says to people "hey, we know you play your blues in second position
but you'd like to have some minor chords there so here's 



And if you have any doubts about whether it's legit to move from a major to a minor triad on
The V chord as we would be doing when moving from 1st to 2nd position on this
Mixolydian tuned Richter harp, just remember that sure while there are no rules in
Music, we do at least know that this is common enough from all our I to V chord changes in
The 12 bar blues where we typically will transition from mixolydian in second position to Dorian
In 3rd position, where we can clearly see that a minor triad is part of the scale.
