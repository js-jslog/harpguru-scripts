This week Howard Levey released a video telling a story of the harmonica's strange & convenient affinity to certain sounds, how minor departures from those sounds
*can* require a major rethink to achieve, and yet how many solutions are waiting for us in alternate positions.

His story, I think, is intended to get us excited about the process of discovery rather than offer any kind of tutorial and that's why Howard, who is
of course a master of shifting between positions without much thought, leaves the specifics of what he's playing as just a support to the story itself.

But still, we're all curious aren't we, so I've stuck Howard in a little window down in the right, and I'm just going to let him go and annotate what
he's playing using Harp Guru which will help you connect with the specific pros and cons that he's encountering in each position. The notes that Howard is
playing in every lick here are from the blues scale. Initially he's not playing the C, the 4th, so I'll unhighlight that now, and then later when
he swaps it back in for the 5th you'll see the highlighting swap then too.

Now, having studied this a little I need to speculate slightly on one potentially missing detail in the original video which, having been taken in something
like a single take is of course excusable from Howard, but while it doesn't detract from the original story at all, it is likely to lead to confusion in this
more detailed look so I will jump in momentarily when that happens to clarify, but other than that, and with thanks to Howard for his permission on this, it's
over to you Howard!
