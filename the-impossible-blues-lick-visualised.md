This week Howard Levey released a video telling a story of the harmonica's strange & convenient affinity for certain sounds, and how minor departures from those sounds
*can* require a major rethink, but yet how many solutions are waiting for us in alternative positions.

His story, I think, is intended to get us excited about the process of discovery rather than offer any kind of tutorial and that's why Howard, who is
of course a master of shifting between positions without much thought, leaves the specifics of what he's playing as just a support to the story itself.

But still, we're all curious aren't we, so I've stuck Howard in a little window down in the right, and I'm just going to let him go and annotate what
he's playing using Harp Guru which will help you connect with the specific pros and cons that he's encountering in each position. The notes Howard is
playing are all from the blues scale, but I'll unhighlight certain notes when they aren't relevant so that you can follow more easily.

He doesn't play *exactly* the same lick every time, and I'll include some written comments to clarify what's going on sometimes, but other than that
and with thanks to Howard for his permission on this, it's over to you Mr Levey.

Yea, and that's it apart from one potential point of confusion which I'll have to speculate on. Some of you might have noticed that when Howard was
playing the riff on the Eb harp, he had to discard it because the director wanted a scoop from the 1 down to the 7b and back up again. (cut to evidence)

In the final version there is no clear scoop available from the 1 to the 7b. There are a couple of possible explanations. One is that even though there isn't
a continuous scoop from the 1 to the 7b, there is a partial one between the 7 & 7b which might have been sufficient. The other explanation is that Howard mispoke
and meant to say that the director wanted a scoop between the 1 & the 3b. The video looks like it was filmed in a single take with minor cuts so such a mistake would
be completely understandable and it doesn't actually detract from the original story at all, but in this context it needed addressing, because I know, as one
of the types of people who would watch a video like this that that is just the kind of thing that I want to know other people have noticed too.

I am of course a huge admirer of Howard Levey and I hope everyone finds this video useful in the way it's intended rather than as something with any negative
conotations at all. Nothing but love here for Howard and the whole harping community.

If you did find it useful then please give the video a like and a comment, I'd love to know whether this has helped or if you've seen anything else that I've missed.
