Here are some of my responses to some sensible criticisms of the 42 other positions of richter vieo in the harmonica hangout discord server.

I'm convinced that there is more to the way that we colloquially understand positions than the hardline theoretical circle of 5ths perspective. That's not to say that the latter is wrong. I just don't think that it covers the way we talk and think about it every day.

It's a really interesting boundary issue isn't it. Are 2 harps the same instrument if they have different tunings? Clearly there are only 12 positions available on a single 12tet instrument, and the only way that holds up on harps is if we consider each instrument to only have 1 tuning. The idea in the video which tries to justifies it's title is that there is a common thread running through all the Richter tunings, meaning that Richter itself is the parent of 7 instruments each with the 12 positions you'd expect of a chromatic instrument.

Choosing to only highlight 7 of those positions to arrive at 49 instead of 84 was a decision I might regret though :joy: The reason for that decision came from honouring the harps origins as a diatonic rather than chromatic instrument. You can only play 7 positions if you don't have bends.

And then I suppose your point @Jordon "Smol Cat" Baade is that we shouldn't conflate positions with the characteristics which emerge from playing different tuned harps in "the same" position. I totally agree with that. Arguably playing a Bb tuned trumpet in second position is the same thing as playing a Bb harp in second position from a narrow / literal / accurate perspective. 

But, on harps anyway, we do enjoy taking advantage of different "textures" as you're calling them (which I like) which happen when you use different positions on the same harp.

It would be a fair criticism to say that I'm making the same conflation in this video by labelling the "different textures" you get with the same position on different tunings as "different positions".

Here's a simple example. When you think about the benefits of "3rd position" (on a major diatonic), I'm certain that one of the things you think about is that there is a minor triad chord available which isn't available in 1st or 2nd position.  Well on a Lydian tuned Richter, third position doesn't have a minor triad chord available. Now it's possible to argue that these are still both 3rd position and I might agree from a technical perspective. But I would say that that definition is incompatible with our common usage. One way to reconcile that incompatibility is to say "yes they are both 3rd position, but they are on different instruments". I'm not married to either interpretation but there's a semantic issue there to be acknowledged.

Under the "pure" definition of positions (as I'll call it for now) I totally agree with your analysis and everything that Winslow & the other "pure" advocates were saying over the weekends conversation. However, I'm absolutely certain that everyone deviates from the "pure" definition in their normal mode of thinking. For example, it's common for people to say things like "I love 3rd position". Using "position" like that is definitely fine in my book, but when we say that we're saying "I love 3rd position because I like the patterns and chords available", rather than "I love 3rd position because I've got a C harp but it means I can play in D".

So, I'm still in defense of the idea that the way we most commonly think about positions should result in 12 positions on each tuning. (resulting in many many positions). Not that that invalidates any other definition on positions. In fact those definitions might be more "correct" and we should change our ways, but at the moment I don't believe that's how we think about them most of the time.
