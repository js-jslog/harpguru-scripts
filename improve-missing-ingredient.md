Improv, the missing ingredient

This is 2nd position and it's supposed to be our closest friend on the harmoniaca. It's usually the first position we're introduced to, rightly or wrongly, and it's the one that we're spending most of our time with. So why is it that people spend years practicing their scales and perfecting their techniques while in second position, and learning the second position songs of masters only to find that they feel just as uninspired and lost during improv as a beginner. Well clearly there's something missing in their relationship with 2nd position, and today I want to highlight something I've found really useful in bringing together my abilities (such as they are at this point) in to something with some free musical expression to it and not recycling riffs and noodling around in scales.

This is something that can benefit players of all levels and works in every position, and as usual I'm going to try and sell you Harp Guru in the process so strap in and prepare to have your whole world transformed, once again.


To *start* playing in second position, *all* you need to do is use these holes as your root note, the 2draw, 3blow, 6blow and 9blow. 

That's fine, you probably already knew that, you think. But how much time have you spent drilling this? Uh oh, now this sounds like it going to be even more boring than scales practice, but just stop right there. I'm telling you it's not. In fact I'm telling you that really getting your mind and body familiar with the sound and feel of these notes, and exploring the creative opportunites that limiting your options brings you is much more fun than scales, and is in fact much more fun than the uninspired improv you find yourself doing at least some of the time.

For what it's worth I've recorded myself just playing these notes along to a funk backing track. It was fun and it's really not simple. Once your sense of musicality tries to get involved you'll either discover that you've got a lot more to learn about where your root notes are all over the harp than you thought you did, or you'll just find yourself playing with a freedom and creativity you didn't realise you had or would be possible with just one note.

Now apart from being a great shortcut in to meaningful improv, even for beginners, this exercise will give you the confidence that so many people lack to move up the harp later on. Many intermediates are still missing this ability and it's one of the key dynamic tools which improvisers use. Very simple but very effective so get a funky jam track on and show them what you can do with just 3 identical notes. It's probably *as* interesting as what many can do with a whole scale.

That's step 1. Step 2 is to start adding more notes. Let's add in the 4th and the 5th. Arguably these are the two most important notes after the root. The 5th certainly, and the 4th well if we're playing over a 12 bar progression it's an obvious choice. I recorded myself again, and what I want to emphasise isn't my playing ability, certainly not, it's just to help you see that there's music to be made even with just 3 notes. Again, more fun than practicing scales and it should get you thinking about the individual relationships between notes with a lot more focus. These little chunks, these shapes can really lodge themselves in your mind and when play with these shapes in mind and only a few notes coming out your instrument and in to your ears you give your brain this great opportunity to bring together and solidify a visual and audio model.

Step 3 is to repeat step 2 with a different chunk of notes. Maybe a major triad all over the harp. Or maybe the root 5th and flat7 all over the harp. And the more of these little chunks you practice the more context you are adding to your full scales. Ultimately it is the full scale you want to permit yourself to use. All of this is to help you feel what's going on inside your scales, and understand your positions in full. Honestly when I'm improvising now I'm seeing these colours and the shapes of the chunks in my mind and with that, I've got no fear of getting lost in the upper octave. NO FEAR. At all. Just consider that.


I've also realised how stupid was my previous inhibition to going up the harp during minor blues, and I realised it's because practicing the minor pentatonic scale had this big roadblock in the middle of it where the flat3 was not accessible to me, being on an overblow. Well as soon as you're no longer practicing this as one linear scale, but a series of chunks you realise that big roadblock is actually just a missing note. There's a lot more to a minor sound than the flat3 alone.

So if you want to build and strengthen your mental model both visual and oral, improve your ability to convert ideas to action on the fly, open up the full range of the harp to all of your existing abilities, unlease your creativity and add a fun practice to your routine then I encourage you to give this a try.

You can do this without Harp Guru, but do bring some kind of visual element to support your mental model. I've linked some alternative web apps in the description, but if you want to use Harp Guru's sophisticated layout modelling and unique Quiz mode which I'm demonstrating now then pop over to the Google or iOS stores and download now.

Thanks for making it to the end of the video. You're a legend.









relationships between them clearly now it's been an absolute game changer. I'm not the slickest player, but if you tell me to slide up to 6 in a few different positions now I can do it well. And if I play a riff in the lower octave I can repeat it in a higher octave. It's been a completely liberating experience and it only took me a couple of weeks to go through everything I've talked about here to finally feel comfortable in second position.



So now that you're happily droning along with a G, let me give you my first piece of advice; practice jumping around between these root notes. The root is the safest note you can hit, They will always sound great, even if you mess up a bit like you can hear me doing now. I know you can because I've already recorded it, and it was really fun, really challenging and definitely felt like improve - except I could do it! Reducing your melodic options means you can really focus on rythm and texture, and if anyone tells you you can't be musically expressive without melody then they're wrong. Just ask a drummer.


So now that we're happily *jumping* around on G, we'll soon want to be playing some other notes along with it, and often the first notes that we'll be interested in are the 4th and the 5th. The 5th in partiular is absolutely fundamental to almost every single musical structure you'll encounter, whether you know it or not, and while the 4th is also important the real reason I'm introducing them together here is because they are the core of the 12 bar blues, which is the core of much of our harmonica improv isn't it, so you'll want to be totally confident about the location of these 3 notes throughout 2nd position won't you and you'll notice, all very easily playable all the way up and down the harp so guess what I'm going to suggest next. Yes, learning to jump around between the roots and 5ths in particualr, is going to bring you so much confidence later on, and confidence right now for that matter. If you tried the previous exercise with just the root note and were surprised about the freedom of expression, and you can gradually get confident in the locations of all 11 of these holes, then you'll be amazed how suddenly you can feel orientated and expressive within a 12 bar jam track. Everything you're hearing in the background now has taken place only on the root 4th and 5th.

I'm hitting some dud notes because I'm no performer, and despite that, I can do this exercise, hear a note in my mind, and know where to jump to to hit it. Then fail to hit it but you know I'm feeling the music and having fun and if I can do it, so can you.

From here, I think you get the point. If you know the notes of your scales then this video is essentially inviting you to stop playing with all of them at once and just take them on in chucks, *all the way along your harp*. Never feel content with half a harp, and have faith that it can actually be very simple to build up your ability to jump around and up your harp. It's not *easy* but its actually fun and creative which is more than can be said for scales practice.

We need to, and we will, discuss how you can build a good enough mental model of the location of these notes to do this. Harp Guru is very useful here, but it's not essential so stick around and we'll get to that soon, but what we've just seen means that improv is an option, even for real beginners as long as you've got a sense of rythm. And all you intermediates who find yourselves sounding repetative. Try simplifying your pallet a little bit and moving around with a bit more freedom. You might discover that you have blown past a lot of stuff which is the key to building real comfort. And this goes for *any* position.

So, what to introduce next? Well I think you get the idea that I think that playing around with small batches of notes is a great way to get confortable with them but I'll leave it to you to apply that to what comes next. I'll just say though that *whatever* you are doing, and whatever "bad" notes you hit in the process, there is nothing that can't be recovered from with a confident slide to a root or a 5th. Just saying it one more time. Ok and I'll move on.

A description of 2nd position would not be complete without talking about the 2 pentatonic scales. These are *the* sweet spot between safety and expressiveness. Just like the root and 5th alone, there is more expression here than you would think possible with 5 notes, and yet, every single one will always sound great, as long as you can get your major and minor right (but that's easy).

Now, learning the scales and becoming comfortable with their notes are very different tasks. There are lot's of lessons talking about the importance of being able to run through these scales smoothly, and that is absolutely something you should practice, but there are other angles to approach this from which I encourage you to consider. One of the problems with practicing running the scales up and down is that you can become tied to the scale. This is a very common complaint for musicians of all kinds that they can absolutely shred a scale, but they don't have any musicality. So practicing outside of the scale is important to help prevent this problem. Another issue, with the minor pentatonic, is that the flat 3 is missing past the lower register until you can perform and overblow on the 6hole and a reasonably challenging blow bend on the 10 hole. So a lot of students, me included, fall in to the trap of neglecting the higher registers, just because this one note is missing, and the reason is that when you're practicing a scale, it *does* sound uneasy to have a missing note in the scale, but for me that's just an argument to consider other methods of practice. So yes, my advice is to indeed practice the scales, but also make sure you are playing around with patterns in all the registers, and hang the flat3. Sure it's valuable, but it's not indespensible. You still have your safe notes in the root and the 5th, and the flat7 which is arguably just as spicy as the flat3 is really easy to play all over as long as you can double bend the 2 hole. And if you can't, well then just remember that you were making music with just 2 notes earlier so there's obviously lot's to be done with even just a few more.

So how else to practice these? Well to some degree just carry on doing what you were doing before. Just play the root and the 5th, along with the flat7. There's a hell of a lot you can do with just that and I'll recommend a latin jam track for this. Just have a go. Don't even think, just play those 3 notes and when the music throws down another level of energy, match it by sliding up to a higher flat7. It sounds amazing.

So that's simple enough in concept, but we learn quickly that it's difficult to keep in mind the destination of these jumps, as well as the inconsistent locations of the notes relative to each other on the harp as soon as we're dealing with, well more than one note across the octaves frankly. And that's where building a visual model of the locations and relationships comes in. I really recommend conciously trying to build up a mental model and a really useful tool for doing that can be to just have a chart in front of you when you are playing. You can find images of the harmonica layout on the internet for free, there's also some free interactive harmonica reference apps out there which can help here but by far the most helpful and clear is Harp Guru, but you've got to pay your 5 or $6 for Harp Guru so I've linked some of the best alternatives in the description for you to try out while you come round to the idea ;) 

So why is this so powerful? Well let's just imagine we're practicing the root 5th and flat7. Well you get this very clear spacial representation which is going to support your ability to recall where you need to jump to when you need to jump, and how to repeat a riff in a different octave when you want to do that. And this I think is really at the heart of a lot of peoples discomfort is that scales teach you how to move fluidly between neighboring notes, but melodies don't only involve neighboring notes, and if you've just started to build even a simple theme in the lower octave it requires an awareness of what we're seeing here to start thinking about how you can continue that theme in the higher register. So that's what having a chart in front of you can do, and the great thing is that rather than binding you to the chart, the more you use it, the more it becomes internalised. And then that's when you become free. And comfortable.

Now we could leave it there but I will show you one more feature which is unique to Harp Guru which can help turbo charge this process even further and that is the quiz mode. The quiz mode can challenge you on the location of scale degrees or notes and it can be limited to a certain set of questions so we can really target our knowledge on to the just the root 5th and flat7 for example by syncing with what we've been working with on the harp face and then entering quiz mode down here.

It takes mere hours to go from absolutely clueless to pretty good, and honestly when I'm improvising now I've got my eyes closed and I'm seeing these colours and the spacial relationships between them clearly now it's been an absolute game changer. I'm not the slickest player, but if you tell me to slide up to 6 in a few different positions now I can do it well. And if I play a riff in the lower octave I can repeat it in a higher octave. It's been a completely liberating experience and it only took me a couple of weeks to go through everything I've talked about here to finally feel comfortable in second position.

Now, disclaimer, I had already been playing harmonica for a year when I tried this so your experience might differ but you know, it's got to be worth a try hasn't it.

I've put a link to all the background jam tracks you've heard in the description, along with some of the resources you can try for building your mental model and if you'd like to give Harp Guru a go you can download it now for iOS and Android. Please do, it's very very good. And if you have any requests for video content, fire away, I am all ears. See you next time.


, in part because of it's use of colour and animation but also because it's really been designed with specific thought for  are also free or you can download Harp Guru which has the advantage that it's interactive and comes with all the features we're about to see, and more for that matter, just watch some of the other videos to discover what.

I don't believe that learning a scale really helps you replicate a riff in another octave.`

Learn shapes, use quiz mode to pracitce

Notice how you can learn shapes as well as locations here too

So what to introduce next? Well chord triads are at the heart of harmonisations so we should add a 3, or a flat 3. Well that's a decision isn't it, and oh no! if we've got a decision to make then that means we've got things we can get wrong. Well that's true, but I want to reassure you that this is just about the only thing that you can get really wrong in second position, I'm going to put this out there and say that if you do anything else by accident as a beginner you can just jump to a root or a 5th (as you've been practicing) and no-one's going to even notice that you did anyhing wrong.

If you are playing along to a 

And we can do a lot with these, but where would we be without a 3rd. Now what happens next is a branching point for 2nd position and if we deal with it nice and clearly here I think you might get a new perspective on all the 


is useful and the root note will be the root note of 2nd position, 

Double stops
Bends

We can see that there are 2 complete and 2 partial octaves.

Draw holes, especially those with bends on them are the most expressive holes on the harmonica, and many of the most characteristic sounds happen on holes

The tldr is that it is largely to do with the blues.
