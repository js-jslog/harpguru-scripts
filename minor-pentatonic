In a previous video we looked at the basics of the major pentatonic
scale as a foundation to an enormous amount of the music you will
be playing on the harmonica. Well following up close behind is the
minor pentatonic.

In this video we'll take a look at the minor pentatonic from a few
angles, visualising at every step using harp guru to try and get
a firm grounding on this scale, where it comes from and what options
it leaves open to us.

You'll recall from our major pentatonic video that we arrive at the
5 particular notes of the scale as a refinement of the 7 note major
scale. Well the same is true for the minor pentatonic too.

We'll demonstrate in second position initially to keep it familar.
You might recognise this already as the 

Show the minor and how it's just 2 altered tones different from
major.

Show that it's a refinement from the natural minor which is actually
a very difficult scale to play in second position, so it might be
surprising that it's such a popular context to refine a pentatonic
from. There are reasons that we might overlook this problem so
frequently, but we'll get to that in later video's. 

Show that the scale is even easier to play on a natural minor harp
because the natural minor harp, of course is configured to play
the natural minor scale.

Show relative minor and major

Show that the minor pentatonic can be a refinement of several
different minor scales

Minor pentatonic - 1, b3, 4, 5, b7

3th: Dorian - 1, 2, b3, 4, 5, 6, b7

4th: Natural minor is the same as Aeolian mode - 1, 2, b3, 4, 5, b6, b7

5th: Phygian mode - 1, b2, b3, 4, 5, b6, b7
