The minor pentatonic - who are you really

In a previous video we looked at the major pentatonic
scale as a foundation to a whole load of the music you'll be playing 
on the harmonica. Well following up close behind like a howlin' wolf
is the minor pentatonic.

In this and subsequent lesson we'll take a look at the minor pentatonic from a few
angles, visualising at every step using harp guru to try and get
a firm grounding on this scale, where it comes from and what options
it gives us.

Let's take a look at it in second position to keep it familar.
You might recognise this already, in the lower register anyway.
Let's review:

We have the root note on the 2 hole draw. The minor or flat third on
the 3 hole half step bend. The fourth on the 4 hole blow. The fifth on
the 4 hole draw and the flat seventh on the 5 hole draw.

I sometimes feel like the major and minor pentatonics are not that
dissimilar, which seems extremely wrong when you consider that it
requires 3 straight swaps to move from the major to the minor leaving
only the Root note and the Fifth unchanged. I've got some ideas about
why they might feel so related, especially in the blues but we'll have
to save those ideas for another video - so if you're curious keep your
eyes peeled.

You'll recall from our major pentatonic video that we arrive at the
5 particular notes of that pentatonic scale as a refinement of the 7 note major
scale. Well the same is true for the minor pentatonic too.

It's most often identified that the minor pentatonic is a refinement
of the natural minor scale; otherwise known as the aeolian scale.
Let's have a look at that scale now by adding in the 2 and the b6 on
top of the minor pentatonic.

# Play an aeolian scale in fourth position - E on G

That's the natural minor or aeolian scale. It's also possible to end up
with the exact same pentatonic from the Dorian scale which is identical
to the Aeolian scale, except the b6 is replaced with a 6, and it sounds
like this.

# Play a dorian scale in second position - E on A

You can see that this scale is a bit easier to play in second
position (honestly, I didn't play that aeolian scale in second)
This might not seem important while we're talking about the
minor *pentatonic*, but there's a reason we're talking about these
scales, so keep it in mind. We'll return.

Finally, let's just return to aeolian and see
that you can also refine the minor pentatonic from one more scale,
which we get to by replacing the 2 with a b2. This is called the
phrygian scale and it sounds like this.

# Play a phrygian in fifth position - E on Clow

So what's the point? Well consider that we've got 3 scales here with
pretty different sounds which are *perfectly* hospitable to the very
same minor pentatonic.

That means that the minor pentatonic will work regardless of which of
these minor scales your jam track is written in.

So you've got great value for money here, and
great security too. If you hear a minor context, you *know* the minor
pentatonic is going to work just fine. There are some rare minor scales
which might give you a nasty surprise by not working here, but we'll gloss
over them for now.

So that's the message for the lazy, but there's lot's more to take
from this revelation than that the minor penatonic just works.

So, time for some enlightenment. It's a very good thing to know that
you are safe with a pentatonic scale, and it's even better now that
you know why that is. Knowing all of this means that you also understand
that there's only 2 more notes in whatever scale you happen to be jamming
along to. And since we've seen that those notes will only be the 2 / b2, and
the 6 / b6, your task of discovering which notes they are doesn't look so
difficult now does it. Just play a 2 and see how it sounds. Then play a 6
and see how it sounds. If they sound good then you're in dorian and you
can freely add those notes in to your improve without a care in the world.

So here's my claim. Listening and feeling what these notes mean when you
play them is *the* most important task for a musician to become competent
with their instrument. But *understanding* what you are playing when you
hear and feel something that works *is* a vital tool for helping you
achieve that most important task.

There's no music without intuition, and knowledge is the environment within
which intuition is cultivated.

There's much more to learn about the minor pentatonic, and we'll be returning
to this scale to try and get everything we can from it.

One final lesson for today is that what we learned in the previous video titled
"12 bar magic - why the major pentatonic *always* works" is also applicable
for the minor pentatonic, but *only* when the scale at the centre of the chord
progression is a natural minor otherwise known as aeolean scale.
It won't work as flawlessly if you are playing along to a Dorian or a Phrygian.

If you want to know why then go back to that video "12 bar magic", pick up
harpguru from the play store and see what happens when you use a minor
pentatonic instead of a major one.

That's all for today. Thanks watiching. If you have any recommendations or
questions then you can reach me on the email in the description. Otherwise

video's and to do me a very cheap favour too ;)

See you later.

So the answer to the quesiton of "who is the minor pentatonic really. Is it a
dorian, or a phyrgian... " the answer is it's got many minor families and they
all love it dearly, and who can argue with that. It's certainly useful for us.
