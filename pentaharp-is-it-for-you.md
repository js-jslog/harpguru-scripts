The pentaharp is really generating some hype. People seem very interested but also cautious, and perhaps even skeptical. We need to put some meat on the bones
of this concept and nothing is half as good as Harp Guru for supporting what the pros tell us with clear visual modelling, and I think we can put a lot of
speculation to bed and *show* you what Hohner is telling you.

We'll start with a minor pentatonic, which as advertised is very easy to play in 1st position. Not only does it not require any bent notes, but it is regular all
the way up the harp. You can play the same pattern in each of these octaves until the holes run out at the top. That is one of the key selling points of this harp.
We all know it's not only beginners who struggle with the layout of Richter tuning.

There's only one unbent note not highlighted here yet, the 5b, which when included of course makes this the blues scale. So that means that in 1st position,
the default scale as Winslow calls it, is the blues scale. If you play all of the unbent notes you will play the blues scale.

This is called the penta harp though and I think the reason for that it's been built to play both the minor and major pentatonic scales, but not in the same key.
If you've seen my video on relative keys you'll understand that you can play patterns in one key which will fit one scale (a minor pentatonic perhaps), and when
you play the exact same pattern (the exact same notes) starting on a different root note you will play another (a major pentatonic). In this case we can play in 10th position, using the
1 draw as the root note and playing the same pattern we get the 1, 2, 3, 5 & 6 of the major pentatonic.

Now what I've not seen discussed is that from 10th position you have easy access to the major scale, the mixolydian, the lydian scale, and because we've got this
3b here we can also play Dorian. We can also play this like a country tuned harp because we have the 7 available along with the major pentatonic & the option to play a 3b although on a country tuned harp we are able to slur between the 2 & the 3 which we can't do here.

As ever, this is a chromatic instrument if you can hit these overblows to play natural minor, phrygian and locrian, but if you can't then you can just switch back to
1st position and they are available with just the draw bends again.

You can also find a non-bent root note in 12th (you see the green root note is still unbent here - follow it around now), 11th, 7th, & 2nd position which can all be explored in great detail using Harp Guru.

A final point on positions - for those who are confused that 10th position has a root note on the 1 draw, thinking that that means 3rd position to them, just
remember that position numbers are not assigned based on hole location, but on relative pitch. 1 draw is 3rd position on a richter harp because 1 draw on a C is D
which is 3 jumps round the circle of 5ths from C. On the pentaharp in C it is Eb which is 10 jumps round the circle of fifths from C.

Along with the scale opportunities, another feature of the penta-harp which is notable for it's simplicity over the Richter is the splits and doublestops.
The octave splits all require the same 2 hole tongue block. It doesn't matter which note you are playing, either blow or draw, splits will always be the same size
and doublestops will always have the same neighbour, and you can see that in 1st position anyway, we've got some nice doublestops available. The 3b & 5b. The 5b
and 7b. But notice too that this is a different world of doublestops. We can't resolve our 5b 7b doublestop up to 5 7b like we have heard from Richter in 2nd position
for as long as harmonica and the blues have been together.

We're also going to notice our chording options are different to what we're used to on Richter and it's derivatives.
The major and minor triads are just not playable in 1st position, though the minor is in 10th (and is of course repeated all the way up the harp which is nice).
But we can't play a shuffle here, or at least not as we're used to, because the blow chord one position down doesn't even have a root note in it. It is some kind
of a chord in 1st position, but not a very stable one and the key change from Eb to C is not something we're used to in a shuffle. That's not to say that we can't
create something new with this, but that's what you'll be doing, and you'll be out of your confort zone.

So while there are compromises which Hohner naturally haven't highlighted, there are real benefits too. We've covered the main selling points that Hohner had in
mind when making this harp and it looks like there is a lot more there too which probably Hohner themselves aren't aware of yet and if you want to be the one
to make those new discoveries then you'll be able to do it a lot faster and with more confidence with Harp Guru.

Harp Guru is available now on both Android and iOS and you can find all the help you need to get the most out of it on YouTube as well as more videos like this
